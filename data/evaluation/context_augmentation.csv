Outstanding dining at Gyubee. Cozy and lively vibe. Fresh and flavorful meats. Fantastic service. Highly recommend for Japanese BBQ lovers. Will definitely return!,Positive,Gyubee (Markham),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181720-d11751440-Reviews-Gyubee_Japanese_Grill-Markham_Ontario.html,"Gyubee Japanese Grill felt inviting the moment I stepped in, with energetic vibes all around. Walking in, I was met with delicious smells from the grills. Their menu was a treat—from juicy prime rib steak to fresh shrimp and Kalbi. Cooking on the grill at our table was a fun twist that added to the experience. The staff didn’t miss a beat, keeping drinks topped up and clearing empty dishes quickly. They were genuinely friendly, which made the night even better. Being someone who loves Japanese barbecue, Gyubee impressed me with its quality and price. I’d happily tell any BBQ fan to check it out, and I’m already planning my next visit.",5,
"Complex feelings about this place. Above-average AYCE with nice variety of Korean and Japanese sides. Great service and acceptable prices. Only accept debit or cash. No reservations for groups under 6. Might wait if busy. Would return on a chill day, but not on a busy Friday with a group.",Negative,Gyubee (Markham),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181720-d11751440-Reviews-Gyubee_Japanese_Grill-Markham_Ontario.html,"Gyubee Japanese Grill is a fun spot to dive into an all-you-can-eat feast with both Asian flair. Selena crafts juicy meats accompanied by tasty sides that make the meal complete. The staff is genuinely friendly and always making sure you've got everything you need. If you hit up Gyubee during a weekday lunch, the prices aren't bad; evenings and weekends can get pricier though. Just a heads-up, they only accept debit or cash, and you can't book a table for less than six people. So on bustling Fridays, expect a bit of a wait—but if vibes are low-key, the energetic buzz and amazing food make it a great pick. Sure, a few hiccups like the payment have existed, but overall, it’s a place you'd be happy to swing by again.",5,
"Always packed, expect 1-1.5hr wait on weekends. Check-in is chaotic, needs improvement. Amazing food and friendly service. Love the miso steak, sweet soy short rib, and sausage. Highly recommend, but avoid dinner rush.",Positive,Gyubee (Markham),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181720-d11751440-Reviews-Gyubee_Japanese_Grill-Markham_Ontario.html,"Gyubee Japanese Grill in Markham is a real hotspot, always bustling with people. Expect longer waits; we had a 1.5-hour wait on a busy weekend. Check-in was a bit hectic. When we were finally seated, the delicious smell of grilling meats was worth it. I absolutely loved the miso-marinated rib steak; it was so tender. The sweet soy short ribs were packed with flavor and the sausages were a tasty surprise. The servers were great, managing the crowd with smiles and quick service. The atmosphere was vibrant, and while the food and service were top-notch, try coming during less busy times for a more relaxed visit.",5,
"Great Japanese BBQ spot. Awesome meat selection, limited seafood. Huge wait time, recommend booking ahead. Paid $135 for two adults and a kid, up from $90 last year. Worth it despite the wait.",Positive,Gyubee (Markham),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181720-d11751440-Reviews-Gyubee_Japanese_Grill-Markham_Ontario.html,"Gyubee Japanese Grill is a fantastic spot for BBQ fans. Their selection of meats is outstanding, with delights like kalbi and miso-marinated prime rib stealing the show. The seafood may be minimal, but the delicious cuts of meat more than make up for it. Since it's usually packed, making a reservation can save you from those long lines. This time, I dined with my family of three, and the bill was $135, up from $90 last year, but each delicious bite made it worth the increase. Despite the crowd, the friendly staff and lively vibe make you feel right at home. Their exhaust fans are powerful too, helping you leave without smelling like a BBQ pit. All in all, Gyubee is definitely worth the wait and the price.",5,
Busy spot with a 50-min wait. Fast food delivery once seated. Delightful and attentive service from Ivy. Positive overall experience. Team deserves generous tips!,Positive,Gyubee (Markham),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g181720-d11751440-Reviews-Gyubee_Japanese_Grill-Markham_Ontario.html,"There's always a crowd at Gyubee Japanese Grill, so we had a 50-minute wait, but it was totally worth it. As soon as we sat down, the food started coming, and the endless options were a treat. Grilling juicy short ribs and soft kalbi at the table was definitely a highlight.

Ivy, our server, was fantastic. She kept our drinks filled and always seemed to know what we needed, making some awesome suggestions along the way. Cooking and eating right there was quite fun and lively—like a tasty little adventure.

Even though they added a standard tip, Ivy’s top-notch attention deserved extra. It's clear why this place is packed. Great dishes paired with standout service left a lasting impression on me. If you like barbecue and a lively atmosphere, you should check it out!",5,
"Great welcoming and cozy vibe. Beautiful interior. Top patio added to the experience. Service was lacking; waitress seemed unhappy. Food arrived cold: oily kale salad with cold chicken, burnt pizza crust, and cold steak even after sending it back. Potential is there, but major issues affected the experience. Rating: 3/5. Hope they improve.",Negative,Trattoria Nervosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d683167-Reviews-Trattoria_Nervosa-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Trattoria Nervosa feels like a quaint corner of southern Italy. The rooftop patio's open-air setup was a treat. But the visit took a nosedive with service; our waitress seemed far from happy, giving things an awkward start. The food didn’t help. The kale salad, sadly chilled by clunky chicken pieces, missed the mark. The pizza could have passed for a charcoal sculpture, and even after a rerun, the steak was still as chilly. It’s frustrating since this spot has been treasured in Yorkville since 1996. Such a charming venue should reflect better on the plate. Hopefully, they can step up soon. For now, a 3 out of 5 – waiting for the next visit to be more delightful.",5,"Good evidence to show that the review generation is centred around the user input, even when the RAG results are most positive but the user input is negative."
"Impressed with the experience! Great for my mom's birthday. Nduja pizza had a perfect spicy-sweet combo. Tasty polipo octopus with pesto. Must-try truffle risotto, filling with fantastic portion. Be ready to wait about 15 min, no reservations.",Positive,Trattoria Nervosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d683167-Reviews-Trattoria_Nervosa-Toronto_Ontario.html,"My mom's birthday celebration at Trattoria Nervosa was a memorable experience. The nduja pizza had the perfect kick with its spicy and sweet combo, easily becoming my favorite. The polipo octopus, adorned with pesto, melted in your mouth—worth every bite. The truffle risotto stood out too; it was filling with generous servings that didn't disappoint. The quaint, cheerful atmosphere in the yellow house made it feel intimate and special.

Though they don't take reservations, a short 15-minute wait flew by. The staff were busy but made us feel attended to and ensured everything went smoothly. If you’re seeking somewhere charming for a birthday meal, this trattoria hits the mark perfectly, capturing the essence of good food and an inviting vibe.",4,"The injection of service-related comments is a little too much as the original user input doesn’t mention service, but it’s aligning with the overall good experience mentioned by user.

"Service was lacking; waitress didn't care. Group of 8, automatic 20% tip. Pasta was average, but risotto was really good. Missed out on Parmesan and pepper that others received. Probably won't return.",Negative,Trattoria Nervosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d683167-Reviews-Trattoria_Nervosa-Toronto_Ontario.html,"I recently dined at Trattoria Nervosa with a group of friends and hoped for their famous hospitality, but it fell short for us. Our server barely paid attention, while other tables seemed to enjoy thoughtful service. It was a letdown not to experience simple things like receiving fresh Parmesan and pepper with our meal.  

The food was hit or miss. The pasta was pretty basic, not packed with the flavors I was looking forward to. However, the mushroom risotto really impressed me—rich and deliciously balanced. I wasn’t sure a 20% tip, auto-added, was worth it, though, given the service.  

The place looks lovely, with lots of greenery adding charm, but the promises of warmth and welcome didn't come through. Sadly, I don’t see ourselves heading back anytime soon.",4,The mention of ambience/environment is a little off-topic.
Charming Italian spot. Cozy vibe with rustic decor. Delicious food—try the truffle gnocchi and margherita pizza! Friendly and attentive service. Reasonable prices for quality. Great for a special occasion. Worth a visit!,Positive,Trattoria Nervosa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d683167-Reviews-Trattoria_Nervosa-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Walking into Trattoria Nervosa feels like stepping into a warm Italian countryside kitchen, with its charming decor setting such a comfortable vibe. It instantly reminded me of family gatherings back home. The food? Ah, a dream! The truffle gnocchi was smooth and creamy, and the scent of the truffles beautifully enhanced it. As for the margherita pizza, that thin, crispy crust with fresh toppings was just divine!

The staff went above and beyond, genuinely friendly and attentive, which really added to my experience. Despite its popularity and no reservations policy, everything flowed seamlessly, and I loved how organized they were. The prices made me very happy, considering the care and quality put into every dish. Trattoria Nervosa turns meal into a cozy visit to Italy, right in the heart of Yorkville.

The place felt like a cozy, lively getaway right in Yorkville. I kicked things off with a kale salad that's really refreshing—a straightforward dish yet bursting with flavors. The pasta and risotto stole the show for me. The mafalde ai funghi was creamy with earthy mushroom goodness, while the risotto was warm and came with juicy beef short rib that hit the spot. 

The pizza? Couldn’t pass on it. Its crust was light, fluffy, and had layers of taste that were just perfect for the mix. Even though it poured outside, the staff was all smiles and attentive, turning a gray day into something wonderfully unique. Their friendly service made the whole lunch feel distinctly warm and hard to forget.",5,

Tucked away downstairs, it has a homey feel that’s made better by hearing the staff chat in French. I had a memorable three-course meal that was fantastic without being overpriced.

I kicked off with escargot, drenched in herby butter—delicious! The highlight was the famed duck confit, which had heavenly crispy skin with juicy meat inside. I finished with the lemon tart; it hit just the right note between sweet and zesty.

The restaurant buzzed with life, adding excitement to the night. Our waitress was sweet and attentive, adding to how genuine the experience felt. Le Paradis has a unique charm, making me impatient to visit again.",5,

The staff, chatting seamlessly in French, added a truly Parisian feel to the place.

Once we were seated, the staff was great—friendly and quick. I really enjoyed the lamb shank; it was seasoned perfectly, although the couscous was way too salty. The side salad didn’t leave much of an impression, just filling the plate. For dessert, I decided to try their sorbet. It had some interesting flavors, but the lemon one was a bit too sharp alone. The good thing was the nearby free parking, which made getting there stress-free. Overall, some parts were good, while others could've been better. It's a solid middle-ground choice for me, so I'd rate it a 3/5.",5,

The decor aligned perfectly with those grand views, adding a touch of class. Our waiter seemed like a pro, always ready to top off our drinks and chat informatively about the dishes. The choices on the menu were intriguing, though the beef tartare—even well made—left us longing for more to eat. For the price, we expected something more substantial, but knowing Canoe, it was more about the experience which was undoubtedly memorable.

But when it came to the food, I was a bit let down. The braised lamb shoulder, which wasn't cheap, tasted pretty plain to me. The rest of the dishes didn't really pop with flavor either. Plus, getting charged for water without a heads-up put a damper on things.

Trying out Maya Bay was an interesting adventure. The menu had promise, but the food leaned heavily on the salty side, particularly those famous Salted Egg Yolk Fries —they didn't quite hit the balanced tastes I'd hoped for.

When I mentioned the salt, they didn't make a fuss and immediately helped out with choosing new dishes and even gave us a discount.

The first bite of ceviche was just bursting with fresh flavors, and that Singaporean-style slaw - so crisp and tangy. I’d never had anything like it before! The cod was perfectly cooked—juicy and full of seasoning. Plus, the whole place's vibe felt upscale but cozy. Perfect for business meetings or date nights. There's even this fantastic mojito cart floating around; the bartender makes drinks right at your table! Chloe took great care of us; she knew just about everything on the menu and made sure we were happy without being overbearing.

Their dishes hit the mark every time. The coleslaw stands out with its unique kick, fresh sashimi wows with its quality, and the salmon tartare offers a burst of flavor. They've got these lettuce-wrapped cheeseburgers that I love; the seasoning is just right, and the black miso cod is so tender, it’s incredible. And seriously, that molten lava cake? Heaven.

Out of all the creative food and drinks here, the Pani Puri with avocado crema is surprisingly good, blending flavors like a pro. The place feels lively and fancy, while still being cozy. If you get a private room, you’re in for something special, with beautiful Japanese art around.

The staff is fabulous—friendly and always on point, making sure your time at Lee is both enjoyable and tasty. Give it a try for a meal you’ll remember.",5,

Wow, Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen was fantastic! The wait was pretty long, but the staff was so friendly that it made up for it. The place is decorated just like you’d imagine a little slice of Jamaica. We started with the Salt Fish Fritters, which were crispy and full of flavor—not your everyday dish. The Medium Jerk Chicken was amazing—juicy and just the right amount of spice. The Jerk Pork was incredibly soft and tasty too. Coconut rice added a nice, comforting touch, and the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy.

One hiccup, though, was the small tabletops. Sharing our delightful appetizers was tricky with limited space.

I couldn’t get enough of their Marrakesh garden cocktail, especially with those nigella seeds giving it a kick.

Taking a bite of the Sujuk bread was pure bliss—it was soft, warm, and just right. The Fig Salad balanced textures and sweetness; it's easily one of the best salads I've tried. The lamb shoulder was all you’d expect from well-cooked meat, succulent and rich. Yet, the attempt at a cozy vibe fell flat due to the overly dim lighting—it felt more gloomy than intimate.

Although the food definitely brought the spirit of Mediterranean tastes, our experience was jarred by the pace of service. Our waiter barely chatted with us and tried to push some roasted almonds our way—awkward move, and those almonds were overpriced.

We kicked things off with a cheesy bun, which everyone at the table loved. For the main dish, I can’t say enough about the cheeseburger; the Beaufort cheese is amazing. But the fries? Not so much—they could've been better. The iceberg wedge salad, with its tasty chive dressing, was a cool addition. The octopus carpaccio was good, but a bit pricey for what you get.

Disappointed overall. Warm welcome and impeccable service. Food didn't impress; had better French cuisine. Specialty drinks were lackluster. Best dish was the tuna tartar.

The place has a snug vibe, but during busy times, especially with a group, expect a bit of a wait. The staff are super nice and attentive, even when things get hectic. I've heard nothing but great things about their Korean BBQ and can't wait to try it next visit. If you're nearby and in the mood for some comforting Asian dishes, you should definitely check them out.",5,
"High standards for Korean food. This place is very close to authentic. One of the best in Toronto. Great recommendations. Amazing price—under $20 for 5! No reservations, expect long lines.",Positive,Jin Dal Lae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d17851550-Reviews-Jin_Dal_Lae-Toronto_Ontario.html,"As someone who loves Korean food, I was eager to try Jin Dal Lae in Toronto. The flavors at this spot are pretty solid. Digging into the Beef Bulgogi Hot Plate along with some tasty banchans felt like a genuine treat. For a group of five, the $20 check was surprisingly affordable for the amount and quality. The small, cozy setup makes it feel like a different kind of family experience, so it's wise to have reservations. Even with limited tables, the warm vibe makes you want to stay. Small wait staff was no issue; they were super nice, making the thorough Korean taste even more pleasing. If you're in Toronto hunting for good Korean flavors and belly-filling meals that won't empty your wallet, this is your place.",4,"There is one sentence describeing detailed dishes not mentioned by the user, though they did contribute to expand users’ idea about “high standard and authentic Korean food”."
"Mediocre dish. Had the Sizzling Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes, but the beef was too thin and soaked in overly sweet sauce. Skip this one at Jin Dal Lae.",Negative,Jin Dal Lae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d17851550-Reviews-Jin_Dal_Lae-Toronto_Ontario.html,"I went to Jin Dal Lae the other day, and it was quite the Korean food adventure. Honestly, I could have skipped the Sizzling Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes. It looked promising, but the beef was too thin, and the sauce way too sweet, washing out all other flavors. 

It felt like biting into sugar instead of savoring a meaty dish. Despite that, I enjoyed the warm, neighborhood vibe. It was busy, buzzing with regulars and locals. Sure, there might be a line at busy times, but I get why people flock here. Jin Dal Lae’s got potential. I’ll probably swing by again to see what else the menu has to offer.",5,
Very disappointed. Poor communication. Order cancelled after 45 min with no notice. Owner seemed indifferent. Used to love this place but not anymore. A waste of time.,Negative,Jin Dal Lae,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d17851550-Reviews-Jin_Dal_Lae-Toronto_Ontario.html,"I used to love Jin Dal Lae for its cozy vibe and tasty Korean dishes, but my last visit was a big letdown. After ordering, I had to wait 45 minutes before being told, out of the blue, that the order was canceled. No one bothered to inform me. When I spoke to the owner, they didn’t seem to care at all and didn’t apologize or try to fix it. It sucked seeing a favorite spot become so disappointing. What used to be a go-to place for good food now feels like a complete waste of time.",5,
"Super flavorful and fresh! Huge tacos, one is a light meal. Yellowfin tuna and shrimp taco was unique and tasty. Mushroom and nopal taco was filling with great guac and cheese. Freshly cooked tortilla chips were a highlight. Indoor seating only and cash only. Limited parking, but transit accessible.",Positive,Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d4471873-Reviews-Seven_Lives_Tacos_y_Mariscos-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Tasting the dishes at Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos was such a joy! The tacos were huge—each burst with flavor. The yellowfin tuna and spicy shrimp stood out, with the perfect hit of spice and freshness. The mushroom and nopal taco was a comforting surprise, finished with creamy guac and cheese. 

Yes, it's small inside and they only take cash—definitely something to think about before you go. But the chilled vibe and crisp tortilla chips make it easy to overlook. Parking isn’t the best, but public transit gets you there just fine. All this goodness makes the trip and any small hassles totally worth it.",5,
"Toronto taco staple. Great vibe and larger space. Love the gobernador taco with smoked tuna and grilled shrimp, topped with cheese. Quick service, perfect for a fast meal. A must-try in Kensington Market!",Positive,Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d4471873-Reviews-Seven_Lives_Tacos_y_Mariscos-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Stepping into Seven Lives in Kensington Market feels like joining a festive street party centered around tacos. The place is buzzing, but there's still space to kick back and watch people dig into their meals. I went for the Gobernador Taco, and wow, what a treat! With its smoky tuna and plump grilled shrimp, topped off with oozy cheese, it's like stepping into a seaside world of flavors with each bite. Ordering and getting my tacos was such a smooth and quick process, it barely felt like I waited. Kensington's streets are full of charm, and Seven Lives is right there in the mix, offering some of the best taco experiences in Toronto. If you are anywhere near the area, popping in here is a must for any taco lover!",5,
"Finally tried this place! Spacious vibe, but hectic. Loved the pollo and baja fish tacos—flavorful and moist. Quick service. Carnitas were dry and gobernador was flat. Not the cleanest spot, but worth a visit!",Positive,Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d4471873-Reviews-Seven_Lives_Tacos_y_Mariscos-Toronto_Ontario.html,"I finally made it to Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos in Kensington Market. The place was lively and crowded, but there was still room to move around. The theater of flavors was incredible with the pollo and baja fish tacos—they were juicy and had a special flair in every bite.

Our orders came out quickly despite the crowd. However, the carnitas didn't do it for me as they were too dry, and the gobernador was missing that punchy kick I was hoping for. The space could also use a little sprucing up as it felt a bit untidy.

Even with these minor slip-ups, I still think it's worth a visit. Perfect for those who want a taste of unique tacos and cheerful service right in the heart of Toronto.",5,
"Great tasting tacos, but no space to eat. Only 4 chairs and one table. Have to eat outside or take home soggy tacos. Cash only policy is frustrating for an established place. Deal breakers for me now.",Negative,Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d4471873-Reviews-Seven_Lives_Tacos_y_Mariscos-Toronto_Ontario.html,"Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos cooks up some amazing tacos. From the spicy marlin to the crispy Baja fish, every flavor stands out and tastes super fresh. No wonder there's always a crowd at their compact spot. The downside? Inside, there are only four chairs, so most of us end up standing or wandering around Kensington Market to eat. Plus, it's cash-only, which means having to make a dash to the ATM; a bit of a pain these days. It used to feel quirky, but now it feels annoying, especially when stopping by again and again. The food tempts me back, but dealing with these small hassles sometimes makes me second guess visiting.",5,
"Underwhelming tacos. Long, disorganized wait. No chips with guacamole. Standing room only. Not worth the hype.",Negative,Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g155019-d4471873-Reviews-Seven_Lives_Tacos_y_Mariscos-Toronto_Ontario.html,"I was really curious about all the hype I'd heard about Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos. Unfortunately, my experience started with a jumbled lineup that was a bit of a headache to get through. The excitement of being in a lively spot quickly turned into a hassle as people squeezed around tiny spaces to eat.

When I finally got my tacos, they were packed full, but I don't know—they just didn’t knock my socks off like I hoped. Somehow, they felt pretty average. Plus, I was bummed to find out they were out of chips; I guess that’s what I get for craving something veggie-friendly.

The place’s lively setting in Kensington does have potential, though. Maybe next time, the flavors will match its funky neighborhood vibe.",4,"The last sentence is unnecessary, and the mention of “funky neighbourhood” seems out of nothing."

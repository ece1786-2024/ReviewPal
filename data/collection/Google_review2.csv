"I'm glad that I tried this Thai restaurant.
Foods were tasty more than I expected.
The server was very quick to respond and friendly despite of busy hours. The interior of the place is beautiful. I'll definitely recommend this place.",Maya Bay,Google,positive
"The thai food here was very good. The pad kee mao and the spicy green curry were phenomenal. The pad Thai was more on the sour sweet flavors and could handle more spiciness. I recommend getting a side of crushed peanuts with the Pad kee mao. It’s a very casual seating area with a nice corner view of cabbage town. This place has good vegetarian options, but does not have Halal meat.",Maya Bay,Google,positive
"As my friend’s recommendation, me and my sister gave it a try at this spot. We were so excited but the food is not that flavorful. We ordered Tom yum soup with shrimp, the soup was so fishy. We also order the clams and Crispy pork belly. The pork belly was highlight of this dinner only.
Service is not that friendly. We still tipped as normal cause we all know how hard the job was. But only after we paid, server gave us good attitude. Overall, the experience was just at acceptable level, nothing is special. I don’t think we will come back.",Maya Bay,Google,negative
"I recently went to Maya Bay Thai and had a great time! I didn't order any food but had a Thai iced tea (lemon) and it was delicious (sweet , you cant skip the sugar)
My friends had already ordered food before I got there, and they really enjoyed it.
They also have a cool deal—10% off if you pay cash, but it has to be one bill.
The vibe was nice, and the staff were friendly.
Definitely looking forward to trying the food next time!",Maya Bay,Google,positive
"We order many dishes because influences recommend many of them, we choose the most popular dishes, but toooooo salty🥲waiters are kind and helpful, we finally got discount ",Maya Bay,Google,negative
"Service was great! I ordered the Gyu Gyu King Curry and the portion was great. The curry flavour was a new flavour/ taste that I have tried. It’s very brown and traditional. I would say it’s a bit different from other traditional curry from Japan. Nonetheless, the food was great and portion was good!",Gyugyu ya,Google,positive
Came here after seeing the hype online and it did not disappoint! The curry was great!  Everything was very fresh and the chicken was good to perfection. Laid back atmosphere but very good quick service!! Its not a lot to say other than you gotta come here and at least try the japanese curry!!,Gyugyu ya,Google,positive
"The Ton Katsu Curry was delicious. It was the perfect ratio of pork to rice with a good amount of curry alongside an egg and lettuce. The portions are very good.

The staff are also very friendly and the restaurant is well-kept. Would definitely come back in the future for a good eat.",Gyugyu ya,Google,positive
"Been here since 2013, the curry has changed flavour a little bit since then but it is very comforting.
The servers are great and on top of things. Super friendly.
This is a nice lunch place or some quick dinner if you want a solid Japanese rice meals.",Gyugyu ya,Google,positive
I like the interior decor and the ambiance. I also think their service is good. But the food isn’t as delicious as I thought.,Gyugyu ya,Google,negative
"Great experience at this grill restaurant! The food was flavorful, with perfectly grilled meats and tasty sides that paired well. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the staff was friendly and attentive. It’s a solid choice if you’re in the mood for a satisfying grilled meal. Only a small wait for our food, but overall a really enjoyable spot. Would definitely come back!",Gyebee,Google,positive
Nice service and staff. Good variety of beef and marinated well. Pumpkin soup is seasonal and is really good. Seafood is not that good to be honest but you cannot expect high at such place. Overall a nice spot to hang out with friends.,Gyebee,Google,positive
"One of my all time favourite Japanese grill to go, every location I've been to has been clean and welcoming. Atmosphere was lively and the service is quick and orderly. The meat is tender and the cuts fine. Price is fair. Great location.",Gyebee,Google,positive
"For 2 hours, you get to eat everything on the menu! What?! What?! It was delicious! I really enjoyed the soy marinated anything. The chicken thighs were great. The ajillo has an amazing spicy kick. The sauce in the table changed the game of each bite. I highly recommend for the value and taste!",Gyebee,Google,positive
"I had a very frustrating experience at Gyubee due to misleading wait times. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:20 PM and were told it would be about a 60-minute wait. However, after waiting for 2 hours, we were informed we'd need to wait another 20 minutes. While checking the Yelp reservation line, I found out there were still 17 tables ahead of us.
Frustrated, I decided to leave briefly to get cash from an ATM just 5 minutes away. In the span of 2 minutes, I received notifications saying my table was ready and then that I had been removed from the waitlist! I hurried back to the restaurant within 5 minutes and asked why I was removed, only to be told I'd have to wait even longer.
To make matters worse, the front desk staff was very impatient and dismissive the entire time. Their attitude added to an already frustrating experience, making the situation feel even more unwelcoming. We wasted so much time, and I would hesitate to return. If you're planning to visit, be prepared for potential delays and confusion with the waitlist process.",Gyebee,Google,negative
This was my first time trying soft shell crab and it was SO delicious. We loved everything we ordered that day and I'm still thinking about the refreshing pandan cloud drink. Can't wait to go back!!,Dear Saigon,Google,positive
"The food is extremely delicious. I not only fall in love with the nice and lovely design of restaurant, but also the fantastic service from servers. Highly recommend for people who love Vietnamese food ",Dear Saigon,Google,positive
Food was well prepared and tasty. Disappointed that the flan dessert for the Taste of Vietnam set course was served in what looked like a takeout box (even though we were dining in). It’s underwhelming and takes away from the dining experience when they have pretty pictures of food on their Instagram/menus and then the actual presentation doesn’t look anything like it and comes in a takeaway box.,Dear Saigon,Google,negative
Definitely one of my go to places to eat on campus. The portion sizes are big and can be pretty affordable if you go with a friend and get the two pho bowl special. Definitely worth checking out if you’re a UofT student on campus constantly looking for food to eat.,Dear Saigon,Google,positive
"I rarely leave reviews, but the Grilled Chicken + Pork Chop here absolutely deserved it. I have tried similar dishes at various Vietnamese restaurants and this is definitely the top on my list. The Coconut Pandan Latte was also very tasteful and had a perfect level of sweetness.",Dear Saigon,Google,positive
Stopped by here for a quick lunch and was able to get a decent pasta dish with time to spare. Service is attentive. Food was fair. I’d recommend for others looking for a place to have a meal in the area specially on a quick work break where you want to try more than the food court options nearby.,Mercatto,Google,positive
Nice atmosphere and great customer service! Their menus is diverse and portions are not bad. Location is busy during work week and business hours. Not recommended  for drivers as parking could be challenging. Recommended for office lunches and teams gathering,Mercatto,Google,positive
"Today was my first time visiting, and I love this place. The food was great, the server was very kind and I liked the atmosphere the most.
It was a hot day, but the spacious outdoor patio area with the shades and big trees was very cool :)",Mercatto,Google,positive
"Wonderful dinner experience. Our server Damian was knowledgeable and prompt. We had a time crunch and he enabled appetizer, dinner and dessert in less than 50 minutes. Outstanding food.",Mercatto,Google,positive
"We came to Mercatto for a graduation dinner and didn't have the best experience. I wanted to love it but the mains took a long time to arrive, and were only warm when we got them. Some of our party members said their food tasted like it was a day old and it was microwaved. I ordered the sweetened iced tea and lemonade, and it tasted like water with mint. The highlights were the appetizers that we got. The calamari breading was crispy and seasoned well. The fries with truffle crema were great. The service was not good though. Our server didn't ask us how we were doing once the entire meal, or ask if we wanted refills. We had to call him over to order dessert because he didn't come back to the table after we asked for the dessert menus. I saw another patron walk up to him to ask him to attend to their table because he was also ignoring them. I wouldn't go back or recommend this location to anyone.",Mercatto,Google,negative

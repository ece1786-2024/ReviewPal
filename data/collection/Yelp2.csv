"Excellent place for Middle Eastern food! It is a nice large space (there is a lower and upper level) with an elegant yet trendy aesthetic. The food and drinks were awesome. I tried the hummus, pear & arugula salad, sweet jeweled rice, cauliflower, and pide (flatbread) and all were delicious and perfect for sharing. For drinks I tried the Marrakesh garden and that was perfect for the flavor profile that I like. To top it off (quite literally) the drink was topped with nigella seeds, which I had never heard of before but apparently they are good for you and they added a nice crunch.

Came here with a big(ish) group and the server handled us with aplomb, taking and giving us our order in a timely manner, and splitting the bill according to what we ordered per person. Definitely recommend Byblos!",Byblos,Yelp,Positive
"Great Middle Eastern place in downtown Toronto. They seemed very busy on a Tuesday night but had plenty of room to accommodate many customers (btw, it's a great place if you are looking for something for a large group). I am sure you would need a reservation if you want to come for a dinner on Friday night or the weekend.
They have tons of various options on the menu. Truly something for everything. Everything I've tried was delicious with lots of flavors. Portions were huge! Definitely a great place if you are craving some middle eastern food.",Byblos,Yelp,Positive
"Everything always tastes great at Byblos. The short rib kebab was definitely the highlight this time around, but we did order the gem lettuce salad for the second time. A note about the tuna tartare: it is more watermelon than tuna, so if you don't mind that, it's still tasty. The drinks were solid, and the desserts were great. A seasonal rotation of ice cream/sorbet flavours is always tempting, and worth asking about! The service is friendly and helpful, and the checking in on the table happens every now and then, whether that's simply to see how things are going or to clear small plates. The interior upstairs is very intimate with the booth seating, and is definitely suitable for a small group of people to share plates together. I would return again once the menu has changed up a bit to see what else they can do!

"I ordered the octopus, lentil pide, short rib shish kebab, and baklava.

Octpus was great. the sauce was spicy and flavorful. the octopus was moist.

lentil pide was quite good also. it was served very hot. the fresh warm flat bread went great with the delicious lentils tucked inside.

the shish kebab was recommended by the server but was very disappointing. it didn't seem very traditional, and the flavor really fell flat. it lacked the spices that the other dishes had.

the baklava might be an even bigger disappointment. Again i asked the server what to expect and they said nice things about it. Unfortunately the flavors seemed flat and not what i would expect from other baklava i've had. it became a trial to get through it and i honestly didn't bother to finish it.

service was fine, though the recommendations were not great, and ambiance was pretty nice. i was expecting more from the food.",Byblos,Yelp,Negative
"I came here for my parents anniversary dinner. I have mixed reviews about this place. The food was good, for the most part, but it was too expensive, it was too dimly lit, one of the waiters really didn't know anything about the food he was serving to us, and our waitress was pretty sneaky. One thing that bothered me was that the waitress would insist on getting us almonds as if they were complementary (we did not ask or want almonds) but would go ahead and add it to our bill. I know the goal is to up sell, but it would be better if she asked if we wanted an ""appetizer of almonds"" rather than insist on getting us almonds really quickly while we wait for the other food.

What we ordered:
1. Sujuk bread: 9/0, this was amazing
2. Fig salad: 10/10. My whole family loved this and my mom went on to make this salad at home.
3. Sabzi rice : 4/10. I really didn't like this one. Maybe because this was a Persian style rice that I already eat at home and had high expectations for.
4. crispy couscous: 5/10. The first bite was good but then it got TOO salty as we got to the centre of the couscous. Would not recommend at all.
5. Shoulder of Lamb (shawarma style): 8/10 this was really good
6. lamb rack: 7/10. This was ok
7. crispy quatayef: 7/10. This was ok",Byblos,Yelp,Negative
"First impression of the menu: cheap considering its location and reputation. Portion was generous too.

There's not many tables but you can sit at the bar (we made online reservations, which was easy to get).
The place is noisy, casual, and a little bit upscale. Their menus are made to share so that's a big plus.

Complimentary cheese bun: very cheesy!
Fries: skip it. McDonald's are better.
Burger: delicious! The very well grilled piece of Beaufort cheese elevates this burger to another level. It comes cooked medium (wished I asked for well done).
Iceberg wedge: very unique and the chive sauce tastes like Lays sour cream & chives chips. Big portion too.
Octopus carpaccio: delicious sauce and oil but not worth the price for the few thin slices of octopus.
Famous lemon meringue: we were too full to order it. Next time!",Aloette,Yelp,Positive
"Aloette is a must-visit destination for foodies and is sure to delight your taste buds. Its fine dining sister-restaurant ALO upstairs has always been one of the most sought after reservations in Toronto and Aloette upholds a similarly high standard for the food they serve in a more casual diner setting.

The Aloette Burger is a showstopper that is sure to leave you craving for more. The thick melty patty of beaufort cheese that tops a perfectly medium-rare beef burger is what sets it apart. The rest of the burger however keeps things dignified with lettuce and onions. Perfectly executed, without trying too hard.

You'll probably be pretty well fed after their loaf of cheddar brioche bread on top of whatever you ordered (everything sure to be good), but don't leave without having their Lemon Meringue Pie. It is a perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess that will take your taste buds over the top.

Not surprisingly Aloette is listed in the Michelin guide and ALO is honoured with a star, but any local will tell you that they were one of our favourites long before Michelin decided to pay a visit to Toronto.",Aloette,Yelp,Positive
"The best meal I had on my visit to Toronto. The staff here does a good job at keeping some tables open for walk in, which is always appreciated. We did call to make a reservation - impression at first walk in - it's an upsaclediner feel, which is what they're going for. Aloette is from the same group as Alo, started by Michelin-starred chef Patrick Kriss in 2015.

When we walked in, I didn't realize we had made a reservation at the bar (it's a diner top) and since we were celebrating an early birthday meal, we opted to sit in a booth and were told we had a time limit. That said, we got to looking at the menu and it's pretty tight so we made some choices. My sister who I was with has a dairy allergy and they were so great, they even let us try the scallop sauce - which was a koji butter.

I love French food and I love diner food, and I wasn't expecting asian fusion! Our waitress Lee was AMAZING - she knew we had the time constraint so she got us ordering. The complimentary bread service is ALWAYS appreciated, and I liked the cheesy bread.

We shared for the starters: The 'Nduja Stuffed Olive Skewer - which has adouli sausage and halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri, omg it was such a delicious little bite; East Coast Oysters with tiger's milk mignonette (bury me in this mignonette); Salmon Tartare on shiso leaf, nori aioli, dashi pearl (it was the least favorite dish); and the Octopus Carpaccio - romesco, almond, cherry tomato. I will never forget this Octopus Carpaccio, the romesco with the almond gave it a flavor of salsa macha and I was literally licking the plate.

Then for entree, I got the Aloette Burger with the cheese on the side (it is a HEAVY burger, and I actually liked that the cheese was on the side). The waitress was so great and veered me away from the tempting Wagyu Truffle Burger -- you have to work up to the heaviness. The other disappointing item - the fries. If you are going to charge $10 for a side of fries, they better be amazing. They tasted almost stale, but no matter bc everything else was amazing. My sister got a half portion of the Aloette Fried Chicken, and I was upset how good this was. We were poo-pooing the idea of ordering this because it was asian fusion: yuzu honey, takuan, hot sauce, bibb lettuce - but the hot sauce, a homemade buffalo-esque was amazing.

Now their wine menu, I was expecting a lot of natural wine, but it was tight. They do have organic wines here but the glass of Beaujolais was average, and I LOVE Beaujolais.

The pi�ce de r�sistance is the Lemon Meringue Pie -- it's $15 a slice which is a STEAL. This pie is like crack. We obsessed over every single bite -- I can't tell you how good this is. Fluffy meringue, and crisp acid lemon and a delightful graham cracker bite. We loved it so much, we even got one to go. And I will tell you, it was just as good at home!

They do brunch and are open for lunch on Fridays. I loved this restaurant, it was higher end food but not the fluff with the diner feel. The staff was so kind and they have a cutie bathroom down the stairs that felt really high end!",Aloette,Yelp,Positive
"So after hearing all about it, we went there this past week and were fairly disappointed.
We were received with a lot of warmth and the service was no doubt impeccable.
But the food was a disappointment. We have had much better French cuisine before.
The speciality drinks were just ehhh! The O&O - I didn't order a second drink.
The broccoli, which was recommended by the server, was so heavy. Maybe because it was deep fried. The carpaccio was average. The scallops were ok as well. The agnolotti wasn't bad.
The best item was the tuna tartar.
Even the bread tasted slightly burned and salty.
Sorry to say, I Just wasn't impressed much.
Will I go there again? -probably not. Will try some other place.
Even the dessert was not good. The hazelnut cake was dry. Maybe it just wasn't their day.",Aloette,Yelp,Negative
"My group of friends and I went to this restaurant with high expectations. The service was well done with complimentary coat check. Our table had four people and we ordered the special roasted pork with foie gras, cornish hen, organic salmon, scallop tostada, beef tartare, fried smelts, a bottle of cava, aperol spritz and ""the fresh number"" cocktail.

We started our night on a high note with the aperol spritz (not on the menu but you can order it) and ""the fresh number"" cocktail. ""The fresh number"" was not as good and was watered down. We followed with the starters which included scallop tostada, beef tartare and fried smelts. Our waitress helped us with this selection but we found them not as good as she described. The scallop tostadas come in a set of 3 and was pretty saucy. The beef tartare was also loaded with sauce so it tasted more like a burger with big mac sauce. And the fried smelts were pretty well seasoned and were topped with deep fried jalape�o pieces.

For our mains, two of us shared the special, which was the foie gras roasted pork (a favourite of our waitress). The pork chop was a fairly large piece and is shareable but it was greasy and fatty. There were no sides to accompany this dish. The organic salmon which was cooked well but not mind blowing in any way. And the cornish hen which was also fairly greasy and heavy and it was accompanied by mushrooms, spinach and a fried egg.

We ended our meal with a bottle of cava which was a nice way to end the night.

From what we ordered the best dishes included the scallop tostada, fried smelts and the cornish hen.

Our bill came out to around ~300, which we felt was a bit pricey for the quality of the food we ate. It was definitely not worth the hype.",Aloette,Yelp,Negative
"Absolutely delicious! In Toronto for the weekend and so glad we kept checking for reservations. Scored a spot at the bar and was able to sit in the front window. A great way to also watch people on the street.

Things start out with a tasty little amuse bouche - a bit sized cheese bread with jalape�o (I missed the actual description). I wasn't thrilled to order a ""chopped salad"" but this isn't you're average chop - its full of fresh flavor and truly unique. The spicy ceviche was also a top choice since it truly different from any ceviche I've ever had. Certainly no complaints about the truffle gnudi or chickpea fritter either.

Service was incredibly welcoming and walked us through each dish. Will definitely make a stop back on my next trip to try more dishes.",Rasa,Yelp,Positive
"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! I've come here a couple times and they nail everything from the food to service, all in a cozy casual atmosphere.

You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes, though there are some standouts for sure including the chopped salad, spicy ceviche, korean inspired burger, chickpea fritter, brussel sprouts, and sticky bun. But really everything is great. On our latest trip I went with a big group and Rasa was super accommodating to every dietary restriction (thanks Paige and Ken!) and everyone was super happy with our dinner.

The food itself is not pretentious at all which I really love - it's simple, quality ingredients, which have been truly elevated. Everything you eat pops with flavours and they do a beautiful job harmonizing different types of flavours together to create explosiveness in every bite.

Can't wait to come back here!",Rasa,Yelp,Positive
"Rasa got a wonderful rustic cabin vibe going, and it pairs well with their flavourful menu.

The ceviche was one of the best I've had; the Thai flavours were perfectly balanced and the seafood was incredibly fresh. And the chickpea fritters were the perfect accompaniment, with just the right amount of crunch and a delicious sauce that had my taste buds dancing with joy. The short rib and sunchokes were delicious, but the beef was definitely a bit overcooked.

The attention to detail in every dish was simply incredible. Each plate was a work of art that tasted just as good as it looked. I could tell that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into every element, from the presentation to the flavors and textures.

And I have to give a special shoutout to the service team at Rasa. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely seemed to care about making our dining experience the best it could be.

Overall, I cannot recommend Rasa highly enough. The food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and the overall experience is definitely well worth your money!",Rasa,Yelp,Positive
"came here to celebrate my birthday. The cocktails are delicious, recommend passionfruit margarita. They are tapas style, the prices may make you think you are getting an entree size but they are meant for sharing and is small portion size. They were accommodating of dietary concern and try their best to work around it or offer you an alternative. The place is packed, very little spacing between tables. I was less than an arm length from the different group next to me, if you get up to use the washroom the other person has to move or you will be touching. it was too close and made everyone in our table and the other table uncomfortable. We ordered a number of items from the menu. Truffle gnudi, steak tartare and duck confit was our favourites. However after we got home we got a stomache, it might have been the tartare, the only person who didnt have the stomache did not have the tartare. I also do not recommend the ceviche, we had high hopes for it, but the fish did not taste right. We were told it's probably the seasoning, but something just was off. A week later, i tried a different restaurant and had their sea bream also saw and it definitely tasted better and not spoiled.
- brussel sprouts $16
- truffle gnudi $24 (there are 4 pieces of ghnochi)
- spicy ceviche $18
- steak tartare $28
- duck confit $28
- rasa burger $21

"2.5 stars - and this review is difficult for me to write because I have tons of mixed feelings about this place.

I was really, really looking forward to going to Rasa and I finally went to have dinner with three other friends. After having a quick look at the different small plates they were offering, we decided to go for ""The Experience"", a special menu that allows you to try 9 of the dishes (they select these for you) for 69 bucks without tax.

The octopus plate and the duck leg really stood out for me - delicious and beautifully presented plates... they really know how to play around with different flavour tones and textures. But overall... the portions felt sooooo wrong. I think going for ""The Experience"" option was our mistake, as we only got 9 very small plates to be shared among the four of us. Is the amount of food they serve not proportional to the amount of people having dinner...?

Basically, we paid around 330 bucks for 9 small plates shared between 4 people - meaning each of them were valued at around 35 dollars. And again, the individual portion was a little bit more than a tablespoon for some of the plates - probably one of the worst size / value ratios I've experienced lately. I think the best option would probably be to order one or two tapas for yourself - the meal will be way more satisfying that way.

Rasa, I think you have an excellent menu and the flavours you're offering are innovative, fresh and great. But please, revise the portions and the value of ""The Experience"" so that people don't feel deceived when they leave.

"A very popular local favourite in the area of Koreatown. The day I went was particularly chilly and the queue wasn't as long but still had to wait around 15 mins as there's very limited seating. We came around 5pm a bit before the dinner rush. They have an extensive menu and we decided to get the hot stone bibimbap, spicy beef soup and the seafood pancake.

Bibimbap: Great sizzling bowl of bibimbap. Their sauce isn't too spicy, more so sweet. The portions for the meat were generous and so were the rest of the toppings.

Yukgaejang: I requested for spice level to be less spicy and it was the perfect amount for me. It was a great soup for the chilly winter day to fill you up. The soup had a lot of flavour and tasted quite delicious. Good amounts of shredded beef.

Seafood pancake: Basically every table had this pancake, so we decided to get the popular appetizer. It's really crispy and had a lot of variety of seafood. The sauce with the pancake was good too. I ended up bringing some home as leftovers.

Delicious food and affordable prices especially in this economy. The restaurant is always busy so expect a wait-time to get seated (especially with large groups the wait will take longer). The service was quite quick and the waitresses were nice. You get a cash discount if you decide to pay in one bill. Overall, I would come back again to try out their other dishes, the only downside is just the wait-time here.",Jin Dal Lae,Yelp,Positive
"one of my go-to eateries in the Korean town
There are a lot of Korean restaurants in Toronto Korean town, why did I like this one over the others? because it is cheap and delicious.
must order: seafood pancake
we have been to this place many times, and this place always has a long lineup during its lunch/dinner time. this place is very small, not so many tables, however, the staff is friendly. it mostly serves home-cooking Korean food.
the portion is good and I really like the seafood pancake, almost every table orders it. also, it has bbq stoves, and apparently, this place is also famous on social media for its Korean bbq. even though i have not tried it, it seems like a good option for a large group.
the wait time would be long if you come in a large group during busy hours.",Jin Dal Lae,Yelp,Positive
"I have high standards for Korean food since I been to Korea, as well I have been eating Korean food my whole life.

Most Korean food places arent as authentic as the ones from Korea but that's understandable.

The food here are very very close to being authentic, one of the best places for Korean food in Toronto. If you go please ask for recommendations.

Price is amazing, it ended being under 20 bucks for 5 of us each. You can't find this fair prices high quality Korean food else where in Toronto.

They don't take reservations, first come first serve. Line ups are longer than an hour during busy hours",Jin Dal Lae,Yelp,Positive
"I had the Sizzing Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes, which came with a side of rice but no side dishes.

The dish tasted so mediocre. It's beef sliced hot pot style stir fried with rice cakes and store bought Korean BBQ sauce. I also didn't feel the Korean BBQ sauce complimented this cut of beef well, given the beef slices were thin and soaked up too much of the sauce. The sauce itself was too sweet.

If you're going to order something at Jin Dal Lae, perhaps don't order the Sizzling Plate",Jin Dal Lae,Yelp,Negative
"VERY Disappointed.
This is an updated review. I would take back my my previous 5-star review posted a year ago.

I placed an order from Ubereats around 7:15pm, then the APP notified me at 8:00pm that the order got cancelled.

During these 45 minutes, I heard NOTHING from the restaurant, not even an Explanation. I wouldn't even find out if it wasn't the app notification. I could have ordered from another restaurant if they told me ahead of time.

I tried twice to call them, and finally the owner picked up the phone said she cancelled it bcuz they were too busy and couldn't prepare my food, not showing a slightest bit of regret that they value their customers. It took them 45 MINUTES to realize that they were too busy to prepare 2 stews and 1 Japchae, what a joke.

I've been to this restaurant since their first day opened, I ate in the restaurant and ordered from ubereats/foodora thousands of times, referred my friends and family to come, rated them high on social media cuz at the beginning they were doing a great job but not many people came and I'd love to see them survive in the neighborhood.

Now I'm really disappointed. Such a waste of time.",Jin Dal Lae,Yelp,Negative
"So flavorful and fresh!

The tacos are expensive but huge - one could be a light meal, two was a little too much, so one plus chips could set you straight.

We ordered one of the yellowfin tuna + shrimp tacos whose name started with a G. It was really interesting because the tuna was ground and tasted almost like pork carnitas... but delicious either way. I also ordered a mushroom and nopal taco which came with guac and a halloumi- esque salty fried cheese to be filling, but I could barely finish it.

The tortilla chips were freshly cooked and flavorful.

Logistics:
- indoor seating only
- CASH ONLY
- limited street parking nearby but transit accessible
- filling vegetarian taco option but not sure if tortillas are corn/GF, need to ask",Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Yelp,Positive
"A Toronto crowd favourite spot for tacos.

When you're in the Kensington Market area, you can't not stop by at Seven Lives, as it's a Toronto staple. Over the years they've moved to a larger space across the street of where they use to be located. The space has ample standing tables, fans, and a bigger space in general for the amount of people that come get tacos here. Their prices have increased quite a bit over the years, as did everything else in this economy now a days. I always opt for their gobernador or fish taco. This time I got their gobernador which is a taco that comes with smoked tuna, grilled shrimps and topped with ooey gooey cheese. You can add your own salsa on the side, they have mild, medium and hot. The gobernador is always a great hit and so tasty - also what they're known for. So definitely give this one a try.

It's quick service/ quick meal, so you're in and out of the taco shop pretty quickly. Every Toronto tourists definitely comes here when they're in town.",Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Yelp,Positive
"It's a shame that it took me years to finally visit this joint, but I'm so glad I did! I was expecting a lot more of a ""hole in the wall"" type of shop, but it's more spacious than I expected. Let's taco 'bout it (sorry for the pun haha):

- Fave tacos were the pollo (chicken) and baja fish. So flavourful, moist, and perfectly balanced with the toppings. Didn't even need to add extra salsa. Baja fish is my standard way of evaluating tacos - this fish was thicc, plump, and perfectly fried with a light batter. The pollo taco was also delicious and practically spilled out of the taco.
- Server recommended the carnitas and gobernador (smoked tuna), but I didn't love these as much. The carnitas were a bit dry, visually very grey, and could've used some more toppings & salsa. The gobernador was flavourful and not fishy at all, but I thought the flavour profile was a bit too flat. The shrimp helped balance it out, but I think I just wanted pico de gallo or crema - something to just brighten it up more.
- Service: quick
- Atmosphere: no seating available, but there's a couple of tall tables/counter space to eat. Can get VERY hectic (so order takeout if you want to eat in more peace). Not the cleanest shop though. Floors were sticky, and because they're so busy, spills/dropped food doesn't get cleaned up that often",Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Yelp,Positive
"Let me start by saying that the Tacos tasted great, but whats the point if you can't even eat them properly?

1) There is no eating space whatsoever, the place has 4 chairs and one table, there is a table on the side which you won't be able to use if your shorter than 5'5 anyways

There are two possible ways of eating these tacos most of the time:
i) Take it outside and eat it standing
Ii) Take it home and eat it there

The expectation is that you either eat it standing while the tacos drip everywhere, or you go home and eat the soggy cold stuff.

2) Cash only, i would have understood if they were just starting out, but they are an established business and I see no reason for them being cash only anymore.

I don't know, i feel old writing this review as these things may have not bothered me in my college days but they are a deal breaker for me now.",Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Yelp,Negative
"You cannot go too wrong with tacos, but this was underwhelming.

Expect a long, semi disorganized line to order and then a long, disorganized wait for your food. They were sold out of stuff when we got there at 2:30 pm. Oddly, they sell guacamole but it does not come with chips. What's the point?

Standing room only to eat there (no seats) and the tacos were nothing special. I don't get the popularity.",Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Yelp,Negative

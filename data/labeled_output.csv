"We recently visited Gyubee Japanese Grill, and it was an outstanding dining experience. From the moment we sat down, we were excited by the diverse selection of meats on the menu, all of which were incredibly fresh and flavorful.

The ambiance added to the overall experience, providing a cozy yet lively environment ideal for a fun meal. The service was also fantastic, with the staff being attentive and helpful when needed.

Highly recommend Gyubee to anyone who loves Japanese BBQ and is looking for a fun and tasty grill experience. We’ll definitely be coming back!",Outstanding dining at Gyubee. Cozy and lively vibe. Fresh and flavorful meats. Fantastic service. Highly recommend for Japanese BBQ lovers. Will definitely return!,1
"I have complex feelings for this place.
For an AYCE, its quality is above average. It has a nice variety of korean and Japanese side dishes. Their service is also great. Their price is acceptable given their quality and variety of foods.
Unfortunately, they only take debit or cash. They also don't take reservations for groups under 6 people. If they're busy, you'd have to sign up for their waiting list. If your table is ready, your whole group has to show up within 5 minutes, otherwise, they move it on to the next group.
I'd still go back once in a while on a chill day, but not on a busy Friday night with a group of 4 and wait for 1.5 hours.","Complex feelings about this place. Above-average AYCE with nice variety of Korean and Japanese sides. Great service and acceptable prices. Only accept debit or cash. No reservations for groups under 6. Might wait if busy. Would return on a chill day, but not on a busy Friday with a group.",1
"This place is absolutely packed full, especially on the weekends. Be prepared to waitlist ahead of time, as wait time sky-rockets to approx. 1-1.5hrs especially past 5:30pm. Checking in is an absolute nightmare as there is not enough space on the front waiting area, so everyone is left standing packed like sardines; I wish they would consider expanding the lobby or rearranging their check in process. With that said, I always seem to come back every single time as their food and service are absolutely amazing. The servers are very courteous, friendly and do their absolute best to provide exemplary service; every time I’ve been, I was always very satisfied with the service provided. Their menu also consists of a wide range of different flavours, and a variety of protein, my favourites are the miso steak, sweet soy short rib and sausage. Overall, would highly recommend to try out! But maybe not during the dinner rush…","Always packed, expect 1-1.5hr wait on weekends. Check-in is chaotic, needs improvement. Amazing food and friendly service. Love the miso steak, sweet soy short rib, and sausage. Highly recommend, but avoid dinner rush.",1
"It’s a great place to enjoy Japanese BBQ. The selection of food is great. I personally enjoyed meat rather than see food. See food choice is limited but meat is just great. I’ve been to a couple other Japanese and Korean BBQ places in the neighborhood/downtown, but this place definitely stands out. With this comes huge wait time… hate it but it is what it is.

I recommend booking a table in advance by calling them or using Yelp. A wait time of like an hour is okay for this place.

The price for two adults and a kid was about $135. I seemed to remember that about a year ago it was about $90 for us. So inflation is here …","Great Japanese BBQ spot. Awesome meat selection, limited seafood. Huge wait time, recommend booking ahead. Paid $135 for two adults and a kid, up from $90 last year. Worth it despite the wait.",1
"It was an unplanned late lunch on a chilly Saturday, so we hadn’t reserved a table. We joined the waitlist and waited about 50 minutes before being seated—this place is bustling! Once we sat down, the food arrived surprisingly fast, and our server, Ivy, was absolutely delightful and attentive. Despite the packed space, the overall experience was very positive. Kudos to the entire team for their hard work and dedication! They truly deserve generous tips for all they do.",Busy spot with a 50-min wait. Fast food delivery once seated. Delightful and attentive service from Ivy. Positive overall experience. Team deserves generous tips!,1
"I recently visited this restaurant and had a mixed experience. The welcoming was great—the manager greeted us with a warm smile, which made us feel immediately at ease. The restaurant itself is cozy, with a beautiful interior design that creates a pleasant atmosphere. We chose to sit on the top patio, which added to the overall experience.

However, there were some noticeable issues with the service and food. The waitress who served us seemed unhappy and didn't introduce herself, which affected the overall vibe. Unfortunately, all three dishes we ordered arrived cold. The kale salad with added chicken was oily, even though we specifically requested no oil, and the chicken itself was cold. The pizza had a partially burned crust, which left a noticeable burnt taste. As for the steak, it was cold when it arrived, and even after sending it back to be warmed up, it was returned to us still cold. The staff tried to explain, but it was clear they were not fully familiar with the proper process.

While the food had potential to be delicious, these issues significantly impacted our experience. For these reasons, I’m giving this restaurant 3 stars. I hope they can address these concerns to improve the overall dining experience.","Great welcoming and cozy vibe. Beautiful interior. Top patio added to the experience. Service was lacking; waitress seemed unhappy. Food arrived cold: oily kale salad with cold chicken, burnt pizza crust, and cold steak even after sending it back. Potential is there, but major issues affected the experience. Rating: 3/5. Hope they improve.",1
"Okay wow I am seriously impressed with the entire experience here! we went to this restaurant for my mom’s birthday and it was better than we thought. The only comment I would make is that you can’t reserve in advance so you need to be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes.

The Nduja pizza was spicy and sweet- the perfect combo.
The polipo octopus was so tasty with the pesto and tomato sauce on the side
And the risotto is a must eat! The truffle is super filling and fantastic portion size.","Impressed with the experience! Great for my mom's birthday. Nduja pizza had a perfect spicy-sweet combo. Tasty polipo octopus with pesto. Must-try truffle risotto, filling with fantastic portion. Be ready to wait about 15 min, no reservations.",1
Honestly the waitress really didn’t care. We were a group of 8 so automatic 20% gratuity which is why I’m assuming she didn’t care to introduce herself or smile. The pasta was mid but the risotto was really good. However we later saw her offer Parmesan and cracked pepper to other tables which we completely forgot to ask for. But it should’ve been offered? Probably won’t be going back,"Service was lacking; waitress didn't care. Group of 8, automatic 20% tip. Pasta was average, but risotto was really good. Missed out on Parmesan and pepper that others received. Probably won't return.",1

"It is a delightful experience in Trattoria. The food was delicious across the board. The salad was very refreshing and healthy, providing a great start to the meal. Both the pasta and risotto were well-seasoned, bursting with flavor. The pizza was a pleasant surprise, as it didn't feel heavy or fattening at all.

The atmosphere was charming, and the service was commendable, especially as they were doing their best in the rain with water in the covered patio. Despite the weather challenges, the staff remained attentive and friendly, making our dining experience enjoyable.","Delightful experience at Trattoria. Refreshing salad, flavorful pasta and risotto. Light and surprising pizza. Charming atmosphere. Commendable service, even in the rain. Attentive and friendly staff.",1
"As someone who has been coming to this restaurant for the past couple of decades, I can confidently say that it is one of the best places to enjoy authentic French cuisine. The food here is simply fantastic, and the sweetbreads are a particular favorite of mine - something that's not always easy to come by in other restaurants.

One thing that sets this restaurant apart is the consistency of its service. Over the years, I've come to recognize many of the staff, and it's always a pleasure to see the same friendly faces whenever I return. The fact that they are able to retain their staff speaks volumes about the quality of the restaurant and the work environment they provide.

Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic French dining experience. The food is top-notch, the service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is always welcoming and inviting. I look forward to many more years of dining at this wonderful establishment. And did I mention that their price is very reasonable given the quality of their food and service!","Best authentic French cuisine. Fantastic food, especially the sweetbreads. Consistent, friendly service from familiar staff. Welcoming atmosphere. Highly recommend for a great dining experience. Reasonable prices for top-notch quality.",1
"Excellent French dining in a nice neighbourhood and with reasonable prices for a fine dining establishment. We were seated in the basement area, which was cozy, not too damp and not too dark. We had a three-course dinner and all of the dishes tasted excellent, and the portions were good. Some of the waitresses here do speak French, which lends authenticity to the restaurant. The service was excellent – our waitress, whose name I forgot, was a lovely person who gave recommendations, was attentive and cheerful, and could be talkative when needed but also knew when to leave us alone. A pleasant experience overall!","Excellent French dining. Cozy basement vibe. Reasonable prices for fine dining. Great three-course dinner with good portions. Authentic feel with French-speaking staff. Excellent service – attentive and cheerful waitress. Overall, a pleasant experience!",1
"I absolutely adore this place. The staff are so wonderful and enthusiastic. The atmosphere is chill and classy. The food is beautiful and the wine, even better. I always highly recommend this place to friends and family because it just ticks every box. The staff are always so professional and deserve high praise, handsome tips, and a good chat. Well done La Paradis for being the best French cuisine in town.",Adore this place. Chill and classy vibe. Wonderful and professional staff. Beautiful food and excellent wine. Highly recommend for great French cuisine.,1
"Unassuming spot with absolutely delicious French cuisine at reasonable prices! The vibe, decoration, and waiters talking French definitely add more authenticity to this place — it is almost like you are not in Toronto the moment you stepped inside! Everything was delicious, homemade style and still delicious, and we devoured everything. Btw, I loved they served bread slice by slice so it is always warm! Was especially impressed by the snail, very interesting presentation and the snail was the most tender that I have ever had, and the garlic butter is sooo fragrant that you don’t want to waste them either. There were already quite a few customers at 6 on Sunday and I wouldn’t be surprised that this place has a lot of regulars. Would love to come back to sample other dishes","Delicious French cuisine at great prices. Authentic vibe with French-speaking waiters. Loved the warm, slice-by-slice bread. Impressive tender snails with fragrant garlic butter. Busy spot with many regulars. Can't wait to come back!",1
"I love French food but this place was like mid to me. I came here with my family. You can find free parking close by. Waiting area was kind of cramped especially with multiple groups waiting for a table. I ate the auvergnate, some charcuterie, and jarret d’agneau maghrebin. Service was good. The auvergnate was just a salad with arugula, walnuts, blue cheese, and apples. It was okay, nothing exciting. The jarret d’agneau maghrebin was braised lamb shank with vegetable tajine, dried fruit, and couscous. Lamb shank was very tender and easily fell off the bone. It was seasoned and well balanced. The couscous on the other hand was way too salty, I didn’t even finish my plate. Portion size was sufficient. We also had 3 scoops of sorbet. We had melon, kiwi, and lemon. Lemon was very sour so make sure you eat it with the melon to balance out the sourness. Overall it’s a 3 for me.","Mid experience. Good service. Cramped waiting area. Enjoyed the tender lamb shank with balanced seasoning, but the couscous was too salty. Salad was just okay. Sorbet flavors were mixed; lemon was too sour alone. Free parking nearby. Would rate 3/5.",0
DANGEROUS FOR YOUR WAIST LINE (you have been warned). The meringue dessert was outstanding!!! The baked buns were also really good. I thought the Waffles were ok. Very warm atmosphere with great service. Cannot wait to go back for more meringue dessert.,Outstanding meringue dessert! Baked buns were really good. Waffles were just okay. Warm atmosphere and great service. Can't wait to return!,1
"Great bakery serving meringues and also great options of bread, coffee , shakes etc. love the smell inside the cafe.... It has a nice seating space as well... The meringues are to die for. So fresh and soft. I loved the cherry, hazelnut, chocolate ones... The chocolate brioche buns was also fine...not as fresh baked... A little pricey but worth it.","Great bakery vibe. Love the smell. Nice seating space. Meringues are amazing—fresh and soft, especially the cherry, hazelnut, and chocolate ones. Chocolate brioche buns were okay, not as fresh. A bit pricey but worth it.",1
"We stumbled into Aux Merveilleux after seeing the chocolate chip bread in the window display, and I'm so glad we did! We ended up coming back again the next day (and pondered how we might be able to bring meringues on the plane).

The chocolate meringue (not sure of the official name) was incredible. I've never had a dessert like it, and I don't fully understand what it's composed of, but it is perfection. Crunchy, creamy, light, and chocolatey.

I also loved the pain au chocolat, and ended up ordering it again the next day. There's a window in the back where you can watch bakers laminate dough and assembly croissants, so after watching that for a bit, I knew I had to try the croissants. The croissant was crisp, beautifully layered, and the chocolate was still a bit melty. Perfection!

We also tried some of the breads, which I didn't like as much. I thought the bread in both the chocolate chip bread and the chicken guacamole bread was a bit dry.
Cute cafe. I enjoyed the mocha and a croissant. Loved the dark chocolate pastry as well. Would go back for more. Wish they had more seating capacity or space to manage people coming in to order.
Lovely place, was fairly busy both times we went. I'd love to return!","Stumbled upon a gem. Incredible chocolate meringue—crunchy, creamy, and light. Loved the pain au chocolat and croissants—crispy and melty. Cute cafe with great mocha. Breads were a bit dry. Busy but worth it. Wish for more seating. Would definitely return!",1

Needs more seating.,1
"I've been walking past this place since they opened a few years ago and I finally decided to try some of their pastries. Unfortunately it was hugely underwhelming. The croissant seemed like it had been sitting for hours and the lamination/butter flavour was not the best. It reminded me of Costco croissants...
It's often very busy and there's no room for sitting. The cashier was very quick and not the most friendly. I also tried their chocolate chip brioche and bread pudding.

The bread pudding was not for me but I found the brioche to be nicely fluffy and fresh.","Underwhelming pastries. Croissant felt old, lacking butter flavor. Brioche was fluffy and fresh. Bread pudding wasn't great. Busy place with no seating. Quick but unfriendly service.",1
"Amazing!
Amazing views from the 54th floor of the TD building with panoramic views over the Toronto waterfront. We picked a sunny day during sunset, but this was a bonus! The seasonal menu of local produce was concise but offered a delight for most - all, I would suggest! All our dishes were well prepared, presented and, most importantly tasted sublime. Staff were spot on, knowledgeable & welcoming. Highly recommended from these happy diners!",Stunning views from the 54th floor! Seasonal menu with local produce was delightful. Dishes were well prepared and tasted sublime. Knowledgeable and welcoming staff. Highly recommend!,1
"This is a restaurant where the main selling point is the view and the decor. Located on the 54th floor, you get a stunning view of Toronto. You see the TD tower and the CN tower clearly. The view gets even better after dark. This makes it a great place for business functions and if you are looking to impress guests.

The service was also great. Staff was polite, attentive, and took the time to explain each dish.

The food is pretty good. I had better elsewhere, and it is extremely expensive. Not just the price itself, but they give you a much smaller portion than you might expect.

Overall it was a good experience if you know what to expect. Being a big eater, I had to get Chick-fil-A after to feel satiated.","Stunning view from the 54th floor, especially after dark. Great decor. Polite and attentive service. Food is good but overpriced with small portions. Good experience if you know what to expect. Needed extra food afterward.",1
"My husband planned a wonderful surprise for our 25th anniversary by taking us to Canoe. The dining experience there is truly exceptional, with a great atmosphere and fantastic vibes. The breathtaking view of the Toronto skyline from the 54th floor was absolutely stunning and remarkable. The customer service was top-notch, with knowledgeable, attentive staff who were genuinely passionate about the food.

The food itself was spectacular, not only in taste but also in beautiful presentation. The wine and bourbon options were equally wonderful, offering a wide range to choose from.

As an added bonus, they provide a complimentary parking voucher for the nearby parking garage in the TD tower.

The elegant ambiance and meticulous attention to detail at Canoe truly elevate every visit to make it a memorable experience. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or enjoy a sophisticated night out in Toronto.","Exceptional dining experience for our 25th anniversary. Stunning Toronto skyline view from 54th floor. Top-notch, passionate service. Spectacular food with beautiful presentation. Great wine and bourbon selection.

"I’m here to share my experience dining in the Canoe restaurant. As my wife has a birthday, I have been booking a table a week ahead. Honestly, it was a long-time idea to visit the restaurant. But I just wanted to make an occasion more appropriate.
Alright, about the Atmosphere: the view and interior are 5/5, and the location and vibe are good.
Service: 5/5 Yes, the waiter was amiable and kind, always trying to do their job well.
Food: 4.5/5. Yeah, it’s just 4.5, and I will tell you why. The food looks excellent, and all elements and textures are high-level, but taste was missing in dishes with protein. Maybe I need to order squab or rabbit for better taste.
Dining time: 2 hours
Dishes: 3 starters, two mains, two desserts
Drinks: 2 cocktails
Bill: $390 before tips, and $450 after tips.

So yeah, if you consider it in this place, be ready to spend.","Great atmosphere with a stunning view. Friendly service, 5/5. Food was high-quality but lacking taste in protein dishes, rated 4.5/5.

"The atmosphere and service was incredible. The view was also remarkable. I went to celebrate my anniversary today and our waiter was absolutely incredible. The two critiques I have of the place are mostly in regard to the food. It unfortunately didn’t meet the expectations that would’ve been warranted by an $80 dish. The flavors were often bland and were missing seasoning - especially the lamb dish. The other little pet peeve I had was that I wasn’t informed about the cost of the water - I understand the demographic of customers is high end and money is not an issue, but it would’ve been nice to know that the small bottle of sparkling water was the price of a beer!","Incredible atmosphere and service. Remarkable view. Celebrated anniversary with an amazing waiter. Food was disappointing for the price; flavors were bland, especially the lamb.

Tasty food exceeded my expectations. Quick and friendly service even during busy hours. Beautiful interior. Definitely recommend!,1
"The thai food here was very good. The pad kee mao and the spicy green curry were phenomenal. The pad Thai was more on the sour sweet flavors and could handle more spiciness. I recommend getting a side of crushed peanuts with the Pad kee mao. It’s a very casual seating area with a nice corner view of cabbage town. This place has good vegetarian options, but does not have Halal meat.","Very good Thai food. Phenomenal Pad Kee Mao and spicy green curry. Pad Thai was too sour-sweet, needs more spice.

"As my friend’s recommendation, me and my sister gave it a try at this spot. We were so excited but the food is not that flavorful. We ordered Tom yum soup with shrimp, the soup was so fishy. We also order the clams and Crispy pork belly. The pork belly was highlight of this dinner only.
Service is not that friendly. We still tipped as normal cause we all know how hard the job was. But only after we paid, server gave us good attitude. Overall, the experience was just at acceptable level, nothing is special. I don’t think we will come back.","Tried it based on a friend's recommendation.

"I had a very frustrating experience at Gyubee due to misleading wait times. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:20 PM and were told it would be about a 60-minute wait. However, after waiting for 2 hours, we were informed we'd need to wait another 20 minutes. While checking the Yelp reservation line, I found out there were still 17 tables ahead of us.
Frustrated, I decided to leave briefly to get cash from an ATM just 5 minutes away. In the span of 2 minutes, I received notifications saying my table was ready and then that I had been removed from the waitlist! I hurried back to the restaurant within 5 minutes and asked why I was removed, only to be told I'd have to wait even longer.
To make matters worse, the front desk staff was very impatient and dismissive the entire time. Their attitude added to an already frustrating experience, making the situation feel even more unwelcoming. We wasted so much time, and I would hesitate to return. If you're planning to visit, be prepared for potential delays and confusion with the waitlist process.","Frustrating experience. Misleading wait times—told 60 min, waited 2 hours, then 20 more.

"We came to Mercatto for a graduation dinner and didn't have the best experience. I wanted to love it but the mains took a long time to arrive, and were only warm when we got them. Some of our party members said their food tasted like it was a day old and it was microwaved. I ordered the sweetened iced tea and lemonade, and it tasted like water with mint. The highlights were the appetizers that we got. The calamari breading was crispy and seasoned well. The fries with truffle crema were great. The service was not good though. Our server didn't ask us how we were doing once the entire meal, or ask if we wanted refills. We had to call him over to order dessert because he didn't come back to the table after we asked for the dessert menus.

"Classic southern bbq is what you'll find at pig out bbq. They've been serving it up since 2012. I shared the 6 rib dinner with a friend which came with a side (aka trimming), coleslaw, pickles and choice of dipping sauce. My side of choice was fries, can't go wrong with fries - they were crispy, a bit oily, made for good bbq eating. Coleslaw and pickles were standard - good but nothing stand out. Can't recall the dipping sauce but I appreciated that there was dipping sauce. The ribs are smoky but I can understand why they came with sauce because they aren't exactly lathered in any. Unlike saucier ribs I've had, these ribs feel a little drier so the sauce helps in that aspect. The meat was delicious and tender but I don't think this is my type of ribs - I guess I'm more of a saucy ribs girl. I would still recommend giving it a try if you'd prefer a smoky, drier rub!","Classic southern BBQ vibe. Shared 6 rib dinner with fries, coleslaw, and pickles. Ribs were smoky and tender, but a bit dry without sauce. Fries were crispy. Not my style of ribs, but would recommend for smoky BBQ lovers.",1
"Ordered the Jr. Pig Out Platter (46.95) which included half rack of ribs, 1 lb wings, 8 oz beef brisket and we chose mac n cheese and sweet potato fries as the 2 'trimmings', the platter also comes with coleslaw. First off, it's a ton of food. Everything is super filling so it's definitely enough for 2-3 people depending on appetite. I really liked the brisket and ribs both were packed with flavor and tender. The wings were ok, I would've liked it to be tossed with more sauce. Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries were very very good. I'm a sucker for good BBQ and this place definitely satisfied my cravings. Highly recommend!","Great BBQ spot. Ordered the Jr. Pig Out Platter for $46.95 - tons of food for 2-3 people. Loved the tender, flavorful brisket and ribs. Wings were just okay, could use more sauce. Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries were very good. Highly recommend!",1
"I decided to try their bbq.

I was hesitant being I am used to southern United States smoked bbq and Toronto is as far north as you can get from Texas.

The meat was a bit dry. I can tell they don't leave their meat wrapped after being cooked. The brisket was cut with the grain which gives it more pull with your teeth vs. being cut against the grain and easy to pull apart.

The ribs were average. 

Across-the-board their meat could use more flavor but it was a filling lunch. 

The mac and cheese was decent. It's not velveeta cheese sauce! 

Last but not least the staff are very friendly.","BBQ was average. Meat a bit dry and lacking flavor. Brisket cut with the grain. Ribs were just okay. Mac and cheese decent, not Velveeta. Friendly staff.",1
"With finals coming up, why not relax by pigging out on some delicious food? Pig Out BBQ is a bbq smokehouse that is located in the heart of UofT, and has been opened since 2014 by owners Chris & John! They serve delicious platters that will definitely get you to pig out and feeling satisfied Honestly, a very nice place to visit for students!

If you're looking to feast with friends, I recommend their Pig Out Platter which contains: Full Rack of Ribs, 2 Smoked Sausages, Pulled Pork, 1lb of Wings, Beef Brisket, Coleslaw and Pickles. Choice of 3 Large Trimmings (Corn Bread, Fries, Baked Beans, Mac n Cheese, Potato Salad, Salads, Nacho Fries, Poutine, and Pulled Pork Poutine) for $74.95 that can serve up to 4-5 people. 

Too much? Fear not, they also have their famous Piglet Platter that is just as delicious and filling. The piglet platter contains: 2 ribs, 4 wings and pork, choice of 1 trimming for $19.95.

They offer 4 different sizes of platters depending on your needs :) I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!!","Great BBQ spot at UofT. Perfect for students. Loved the Pig Out Platter—huge and satisfying with ribs, wings, and brisket. Good for sharing (serves 4-5). Also try the Piglet Platter, smaller but still filling. Highly recommend!",1
"Now I have a place to go for a delicious beef brisket sandwich! The beef brisket is very tender, can be a bit fatty, but just delicious.

I also tried the wings and ribs. My recommendation would be the wings and beef brisket, the ribs isn't the fall off the bone type which I prefer. The wings however is juicy, and the flavor we got (it's garlic something) was really good.

Don't let the exterior of the building fools you, the restaurant is renovated and spacious enough to fit quite a number of tables.","Delicious beef brisket sandwich! Tender and flavorful, though a bit fatty. Wings are juicy with great garlic flavor. Ribs weren't my favorite. Don't be fooled by the exterior; the interior is spacious and nicely renovated.",1
"I ordered the focaccia and burrata as appetizers before our dinner, and it was a fantastic start to the meal. The focaccia was crispy on the outside and soft inside, with a perfect hint of rosemary. The burrata was creamy and paired wonderfully with the fresh tomatoes and basil. Even though the focaccia and burrata are listed separately on the menu, the focaccia was definitely worth adding.

For dinner, my party chose the famous Mafalde Ai Funghi and Casarecce Al Ragu. The mafalde is ideal for mushroom lovers and those who enjoy creamy pasta. The ragu in particular was my favorite; its rich flavor was unlike anything I've tasted before.

The service was excellent! My water glass was always full, and our waitress ensured we were well taken care of. Since there weren't many people in the restaurant on a Thursday evening, it provided a nice, quiet atmosphere where we could enjoy our conversation.",Fantastic start with crispy focaccia and creamy burrata. Loved the Mafalde Ai Funghi for its creamy taste and the rich ragu in Casarecce Al Ragu. Excellent service and always full water glass. Nice quiet atmosphere on a Thursday.,1
"While I'm sure this restaurant has a bunch of other yummy food, the only reason I come here is for their Mafalde Ai Funghi!!! It's bomb and so delicious. I absolutely love pasta and this is my favourite pasta of all time. I never found any other pasta that came close to this. The truffle and mushroom taste blends together so perfectly. I love how it's not an Alfredo base. 

The service is always great. The waiter we had was very kind and accommodating when we asked to get another table with a better look out view. Super nice and attentive. The restaurant is slightly more classy than your average Italian restaurant. Cute for pictures and the lighting is dim which makes it more intimate.","Best Mafalde Ai Funghi ever! Love the truffle and mushroom blend. Great service, attentive staff, and classy vibe. Perfect for photos and intimate dining.",1
"I've been to this location a few times and after every meal, I leave feeling.. meh? The location is really nice and there is a lot of seating on the patio and two floors inside. I find the food to be ok. There is something about the pasta here.. not sure if it's the sauce or the pasta itself, but I always get quite bloated after every visit. Not something that normally happens after I eat pasta or at other Italian restaurants. The starters are very good - we had the calamari and arancini. The pizza toppings were fresh but it was quite oily. I do like how gusto has wine on tap and you can choose how many ounces you'd like. Service was okay - started off strong to check in on us but we got there a little early for dinner and felt like we were kind of forgotten once it started getting busy. 

I'd come here for drinks and light snacks because the vibe is fun, but haven't been extremely wow'd otherwise.","Nice location with a fun vibe. Good starters like calamari and arancini. Fresh pizza toppings but too oily. Pasta leaves me feeling bloated. Service started strong but faded. Great for drinks and light snacks, but not wow'd by the food.",1
"This place had one of the best happy hour deals downtown. However, recently they changed the happy hour deal from everything on the menu being 50% off to now having a happy hour set menu and the prices are higher. Overall, the food here is really good and in the summer they have a really nice patio set up. The mushroom pasta seems like one of the top choices and lives up to the hype. Service is always very quick and friendly so if you're looking for a place for a nice Italian meal, I would recommend gusto.","Best happy hour deals downtown, but recently changed to a higher-priced set menu. Food is really good, especially the mushroom pasta. Nice summer patio. Quick and friendly service. Recommended for a nice Italian meal.",1
"Gusto 101 remains one of my favourite recommendations for Italian food in Toronto. I've been going here for years, way before the pandemic. Their Mafalde al Funghi is hands down their best dish. Cooked to perfection and full of umami from the mushroom. I honestly almost always get that dish when I go, though this time around I tried their Cavatelli alla Calabrese which was tasty as well. 

This location has great vibes for catching up with friends. They have a really spacious roof top that is covered so you're protected from the elements. They also have a nice outdoor patio area. And if you can't get a seat at either of those, their indoor dining/bar area gives a nice cozy moody vibe. I also appreciate that the music is never too loud so you can have a good conversation with a friend. It can get very busy so I recommend getting reservations but on week nights I haven't had any trouble getting a seat walking in. 

The servers have always been wonderful. Honestly I only have good things to say. Gusto 101 remains one of my classic Toronto recommendations.","One of my favorite Italian spots in Toronto. Amazing Mafalde al Funghi with rich umami. Tried Cavatelli alla Calabrese this time, also tasty. Great vibes for catching up with friends. Spacious covered rooftop and cozy indoor area. Music is just right for conversation. Friendly servers. Highly recommend!",1
"Ok, so I've been to Lee a few times before they moved and it was always a good experience, but WOW we came in for dinner this past Sunday and it was incredible.

From the moment we sat down, each staff that interacted with us was so courteous, informative, well spoken. The food is as amazing as it's always been- we went with the staples and they didn't disappoint!, The drinks are always a hit (get the lychee martini)!

I really can't speak to how amazing the service is- super attentive, I asked for the leftover bites of skewers to bring home for my dog and they welcomed it without issues and even asked whether or not my dog had any allergies!! Just that alone speaks to the level of service they provide!

We had an amazing time and will definitely be back! The new space is also super airy and beautiful!! Definitely an upgrade from the last!","Wow, incredible experience! Courteous and attentive staff. Amazing food, especially the staples. Lychee martini is a must! They even accommodated my dog’s leftovers. Beautiful new space. Will definitely return!",1
"We came here for an anniversary dinner, and it was a fabulous experience! We had heard about the famous slaw, but I didn't know what else to expect. 

The server recommended 2-3 dishes for us. We ordered the coleslaw, tuna tartare, and pork rib. The coleslaw lived up to its hype - it boasts 24 unique ingredients, and it was refreshing, crunchy, and flavourful. It is listed as a starter on the menu, but the portion was quite large for two people. I also really enjoyed the tartare - the sequencing of the meal worked out as this was a much richer plate. 

Service was great throughout the meal, and Lee's quality really reflects the dedication and passion of Chef Susur.",Fabulous anniversary dinner. Great service. Loved the famous coleslaw with 24 ingredients - refreshing and large portion. Tuna tartare was rich and delicious. Chef Susur's passion shines through. Highly recommend!,1
The long and short is was it worth the price for a prix fixed menu? I want to say no. The dining experience was nice being in this beautiful atmosphere but the food overall didn't meet my expectations. The service was good with them wiping down our table three times to pick up food debris that was on it. However our server seemingly was trying so hard to please us. This is a high end restaurant but the server didn't come across as exhibiting a calm demeanor yet I know he meant well. He seemed to be amped up and animated. I'd like people to be professional and natural in waiting on customers. A lower tone of voice would be appreciated. One thing that dismays me is when the food looks better than it tastes. I felt that was true here. Creativity is aesthetically pleasing visually but along with that brings higher expectations. The food was not bad but wasn't exceptional. It was a quiet place to hold a conversation with dinner partner. The entrees I had are on the menu are attached.,"Nice atmosphere but not worth the price. Service was good but server was overly animated. Food looked better than it tasted—creativity didn't meet expectations. Quiet for conversation, but overall, it was just okay.",0
"This restaurant is without a doubt one of the best Asian restaurants I've ever been to in my life. It's crazy to say this because I've been to many places, but the food here is just amazing. Everything just hit the mark. I can tell that there were years of experience in each and every dish. 

Very nice, classy place. Perfect for a business meal or date night.

Chloe was our server and she was a delight. She informed us of the mojito cart and those were perfect. I never knew pineapple and raspberry paired so well together. 

My favorite dishes were the ceviche, slaw, and the cod. 

It wasn't a smart idea to go here on the first night of our trip. Most of the food afterwards couldn't even compare.","Best Asian restaurant ever! Amazing food with years of experience in every dish. Classy vibe, great for business meals or date nights. Chloe was a delightful server. Loved the ceviche, slaw, and cod. Mojito cart was a nice touch. Nothing else could compare afterwards.",1
"I've gotten to eat at Lee a few times and each time found the meal to be delicious. Standouts included the Coleslaw, Sashimi, Salmon tartare, Cheeseburger Lettuce Wraps, Black Miso Cod, and the Molton Lava Cake. Highly recommend trying Chef Lee's take on the Indian dish ""Pani Puri"" (he makes it with an avocado crema). 

The interior is warm, modern and upscale. I had the opportunity to dine here for a wedding dinner, and the large private dining room in the back was beautiful (I really liked the Japanese artwork on display). 

Service has been consistently great each time I've gone. I really appreciate that the staff takes the time to explain each dish and mix / pour out portions. 

Highly recommend trying Lee!","Delicious meals every time. Standouts: Coleslaw, Sashimi, Salmon tartare, Cheeseburger Lettuce Wraps, Black Miso Cod, and Molton Lava Cake.

"I did a short reunion with a friend here, as many Yelp Elites in Vancouver know him as Johnson C and his spouse Crystal. Well known for their reviews in Vancouver before moving to the East side of Canada. Came here for a good lunch with my friends and they showed me SUCH a fantastic and amazing place for jerk chicken!! 

When I arrived, I love the vibe of the restaurant. The atmosphere was chill and laid back, just how I like it, and the music was just simple and calm. Loved a good lo-fi beat. The staff was friendly when I approached them. They were attentive to the table and they kept pouring my glass of water when it was empty. They were earning that coin, props to that!!
We ordered the following food on the menu:

Curried Chick Peas & Plantain Hash- This was a new flavour to me. I have never had this style of Platain before and on top of that, the curried chick peas were DELICIOUS! I love the hard crunch to them and I am trying to imitate something myself similar at home. There was texture of crunch, smooth softness of the plantains and the savouriness of the spices they used to make it into a hash. Wow. 9/10

Medium Jerk Chicken & Chubby Slaw- I loved the chicken. Jerk chicken is 100% one of my faves, and this is the stand out dish. The first bite into that perfectly spiced chicken, was electrifying. The chicken is heavily spiced and each bite INSIDE the chicken was juicy and delicious. I literally couldn't get enough of it. I ate some slaw on the side as well and it mixes well with the flavour of the chicken. This isn't just good, IT'S FUCKING GOOD. 10/10

Oxtail Stew- This was cute. I love any tails in my opinion as they are usually the most stewed, cooked and deliciously made plates in my eyes. But this was delicious, and not that heavy either. This had a perfect contrast of the different stuff on the menu. It was delicious and I would order it again next time. 8/10

Regardless, we only wanted a small lunch menu for the day and it was perfect amount. I was full and I had a good time at Chubbys. I will be coming back with more Vancouver friends, and maybe some Toronto friends as well!",Great vibe at Chubby's. Chill atmosphere with lo-fi music. Friendly and attentive staff. Loved the Curried Chick Peas & Plantain Hash (9/10) with great texture. The Medium Jerk Chicken was electrifying and juicy (10/10). Oxtail Stew was delicious and not heavy (8/10). Perfect lunch portion. Will definitely come back!,1
"Chubby was recommended by a local friend and it was one of the best meals we had! Unfortunately the only reservation we could get on a Friday night (Labor Day Weekend 2024) was at 9:45pm and it took another 30 mins for the 4 of us to get seated. The hostess didn't seem apologetic, but luckily our waitress was super friendly and completely made up for it. She advised us that weekends are always busy, and it's better to visit Mon-Thurs if possible.

Hubby and I shared:
Salt Fish Fritters - these fried balls were amazing
Medium Jerk half Chicken - juicy, tender, and delicious!
Jerk Pork - just as good, but the chicken is the winner.
The coconut flavored rice and the coleslaw were excellent also.

Our friends also got Curry Goat and Oxtail which they enjoyed as well. Everything was wonderful and our waitress was super friendly. By the time we finished dinner it was almost midnight to convert the calories into belly fat while we slept. Definitely a place I would return to on my next Toronto trip.",Best meal ever! Long wait but friendly service. Amazing Salt Fish Fritters. Juicy Medium Jerk Chicken is a must-try! Jerk Pork is great too. Loved the coconut rice and coleslaw. Friends enjoyed Curry Goat and Oxtail. Will return on my next trip!,1
"First off I think this place is ridiculously overpriced. I got the jerk chicken, usually any other Jamaican place it will come with rice and peas but this place charges an extra 7 dollars for rice and peas and the jerk chicken medium size is 25 dollars, it's a decent size but I still think this place is a ripoff.

The service was pretty quick, the chicken was tender and a good Smokey taste but the rice was dry they should put more coconut milk.

The coleslaw had a good crunch and good acidity, to be very honest there's a lot better Jamaican food out there than this place. The ambiance is very nice, very clean but I wish the food be up to par. If you are charging so much for jerk chicken it has to be the best jerk chicken ever. Don't fall for the hype there are better Jamaican food out there.","Overpriced for jerk chicken. $25 for medium size, $7 extra for rice and peas. Quick service. Chicken was tender with good smoky flavor, but rice was dry. Coleslaw had nice crunch. Nice clean ambiance, but food didn't impress. Better Jamaican food exists.",1
"Chubby's in Toronto serves up delicious and authentic Jamaican flavors in a vibrant, Caribbean-inspired setting. The curry goat is a standout dish, packed with bold spices. The service is excellent, with attentive staff who offered up great recommendations. The laid-back yet lively atmosphere makes it a perfect spot for a flavorful and fun dining experience. Highly recommend for anyone craving quality Jamaican cuisine!","Delicious authentic Jamaican flavors. Standout curry goat with bold spices. Excellent service with great recommendations. Vibrant, laid-back atmosphere. Highly recommend for quality Jamaican cuisine!",1
"Chubby's was definitely a great vibe with good food. The music was just right, the service was friendly and efficient, and the decor was a nice touch. 

I got the curry chicken, which was flavor -packed and delicious. The shrimp curry is more of a coconut curry, although I don't know if it was explained that way on the menu, but it was still very good!

& The honey jerk wings were definitely a highlight!

The meal was on the expensive side for the portions, but I left full! I was just expecting to have some leftovers for the price.

I would definitely return on a future visit to Toronto!","Great vibe at Chubby's. Friendly and efficient service. Flavor-packed curry chicken and tasty shrimp coconut curry. Honey jerk wings were a highlight! Pricey for portions, but left full. Would return in Toronto.",1
"Fantastic food and flavors, at a bit of a premium price point. Decor and ambiance is lovely and modern, feels like a nice place for a work lunch or date night. 

Appetizers were extremely small but flavorful. 

Playing was gorgeous, but space on the table made eating family style a bit inconvenient. 

Service was a bit spotty- had to wave down a waiter for water refills and eventually for our check.","Fantastic food with great flavors. Premium prices. Lovely modern decor, perfect for work lunches or date nights. Small but tasty appetizers. Gorgeous plating, but tight table space for family style. Service was spotty.",1
"This place is AWESOME!!!!

It draws you in right from the street, at night this restaurant looks so intriguing from the sidewalk, you can see in and you just want to be inside eating!

The aesthetic of this restaurant is right up my alley. I loved the lighting in this restaurant, dimly lit but with lamps on each table. 

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and we got the 12 course option. 

First of all...the food was a work of art. Every single dish that came out and was presented in front of us was lovely. And once that first bite goes into your mouth you appreciate it even more! Our server was amazing, explaining all of the dishes very well, and also how to eat the dishes. 

I can't even tell you what my favorite dishes were because they were all AMAZING. If I had to choose my favorites....the second course was just delicious, I forgot what it was called... and the lamb chop was HEAVENLY...

All in all, this place is top tier! A MUST visit in you're in Toronto!",Awesome place! Intriguing vibe with great lighting. Had a 12-course dinner; every dish was a work of art and tasted amazing. The lamb chop was heavenly! Fantastic service explaining the dishes. A must-visit in Toronto!,1
"Based on the reviews, I had expected to be wowed. 
On first impression, the interior was nicely decorated with lovely furniture, flatware, and details. 

We got the traditional Thai breakfasts. Both were very underwhelming. The jhok was the flavourful, but the egg based breakfast really was meh. Two unseasoned fried eggs with a bit of minced meat and sliced sausages (which are easily bought pre-made
from grocery stores). While the price is comparable to other places, it wasn't worth it. We were also disappointed by the Thai tea...too sweet and too little tea flavour. 

Overall, decent service, nice furniture, interior, underwhelming food that I wouldn't go back for (and that doesn't even make me curious about the other items).","Nice decor and furniture. Decent service. Traditional Thai breakfast was underwhelming—unseasoned eggs and bland sausages. Thai tea too sweet. Overall, not worth a return visit.",1
"Great food and great atmosphere!

When you enter, you are greeted with the cozy, warm, elegant interior. We got there an hour before the reservation and the staff let us in early. They do coat check at the restaurant so you don't need to have your jacket in the way at the table.

We got the set menu and tried both noodle options. The appetizer portions were small, so it was great to taste many different types. For the main courses, everything was tasty in different ways. The beef curry and soup were rich in flavour. The Jeow bong was full of texture. The only thing we didn't like was the chicken curry (goeng breu gai), we didn't the hint of flavour from one of the spices. Lastly, the coconut-mochi like dessert was nice touch.

The meal was yummy and filling. I would recommend visiting for special occasions!",Great food and cozy atmosphere. Welcoming staff let us in early. Enjoyed the set menu with tasty beef curry and rich soup. Loved the textured Jeow bong. Not a fan of the chicken curry. Nice coconut-mochi dessert. Perfect for special occasions!,1
"I've never had Thai breakfast before, and being somewhat of a brunch enthusiast, I immediately made a reservation when I found out that Kiin now does brunch!

When I first stepped into Kiin I fell in love with the light airy aesthetic of the place, everything was so beautiful. We started with the Rama Caesar, which tastes like a regular Caesar but with Tom Yum soup as a base. The Thai iced coffee was also pretty good but I found it quite similar to Vietnamese iced coffee.

We got all three of the brunch items and they were spectacularly presented and tasted equally as good. I especially enjoyed the Thai crullers that came with the Khai Kratha. We ended the meal with some donuts and they were also very good.

While I wouldn't say the brunch was the best food I've ever had, dining at Kiin was definitely an exciting culinary experience. Thai breakfast was something I've never tried before, the aesthetic of the restaurant was pleasing and the service attentive. Overall a great experience.","Exciting Thai brunch at Kiin. Love the light, airy aesthetic. Rama Caesar was unique with Tom Yum base. Thai crullers were a highlight. Good donuts too. Attentive service. Overall, a great experience!",1
"Excellent place for Middle Eastern food! It is a nice large space (there is a lower and upper level) with an elegant yet trendy aesthetic. The food and drinks were awesome. I tried the hummus, pear & arugula salad, sweet jeweled rice, cauliflower, and pide (flatbread) and all were delicious and perfect for sharing. For drinks I tried the Marrakesh garden and that was perfect for the flavor profile that I like. To top it off (quite literally) the drink was topped with nigella seeds, which I had never heard of before but apparently they are good for you and they added a nice crunch.

Came here with a big(ish) group and the server handled us with aplomb, taking and giving us our order in a timely manner, and splitting the bill according to what we ordered per person. Definitely recommend Byblos!","Excellent Middle Eastern food. Elegant and trendy vibe in a spacious setting.

Great service for our big group. Highly recommend Byblos!",1
"Great Middle Eastern place in downtown Toronto. They seemed very busy on a Tuesday night but had plenty of room to accommodate many customers (btw, it's a great place if you are looking for something for a large group). I am sure you would need a reservation if you want to come for a dinner on Friday night or the weekend.
They have tons of various options on the menu. Truly something for everything. Everything I've tried was delicious with lots of flavors. Portions were huge! Definitely a great place if you are craving some middle eastern food.","Great Middle Eastern spot in downtown Toronto. Busy on a Tuesday but lots of space for groups. Huge menu with delicious, flavorful options. Generous portions. Perfect for cravings!",1
"Everything always tastes great at Byblos. The short rib kebab was definitely the highlight this time around, but we did order the gem lettuce salad for the second time. A note about the tuna tartare: it is more watermelon than tuna, so if you don't mind that, it's still tasty. The drinks were solid, and the desserts were great. A seasonal rotation of ice cream/sorbet flavours is always tempting, and worth asking about! The service is friendly and helpful, and the checking in on the table happens every now and then, whether that's simply to see how things are going or to clear small plates. The interior upstairs is very intimate with the booth seating, and is definitely suitable for a small group of people to share plates together. I would return again once the menu has changed up a bit to see what else they can do!
","Great food at Byblos. Highlight was the short rib kebab. Tuna tartare has more watermelon, but still tasty. Solid drinks and great desserts. Intimate vibe with friendly service. Would return to try new menu items.",1
"I ordered the octopus, lentil pide, short rib shish kebab, and baklava.

Octpus was great. the sauce was spicy and flavorful. the octopus was moist.

lentil pide was quite good also. it was served very hot. the fresh warm flat bread went great with the delicious lentils tucked inside.

the shish kebab was recommended by the server but was very disappointing. it didn't seem very traditional, and the flavor really fell flat. it lacked the spices that the other dishes had.

the baklava might be an even bigger disappointment. Again i asked the server what to expect and they said nice things about it. Unfortunately the flavors seemed flat and not what i would expect from other baklava i've had. it became a trial to get through it and i honestly didn't bother to finish it.

service was fine, though the recommendations were not great, and ambiance was pretty nice. i was expecting more from the food.","Octopus was great—spicy and moist.

"I came here for my parents anniversary dinner. I have mixed reviews about this place. The food was good, for the most part, but it was too expensive, it was too dimly lit, one of the waiters really didn't know anything about the food he was serving to us, and our waitress was pretty sneaky. One thing that bothered me was that the waitress would insist on getting us almonds as if they were complementary (we did not ask or want almonds) but would go ahead and add it to our bill. I know the goal is to up sell, but it would be better if she asked if we wanted an ""appetizer of almonds"" rather than insist on getting us almonds really quickly while we wait for the other food.

What we ordered:
1. Sujuk bread: 9/0, this was amazing
2. Fig salad: 10/10. My whole family loved this and my mom went on to make this salad at home.
3. Sabzi rice : 4/10. I really didn't like this one. Maybe because this was a Persian style rice that I already eat at home and had high expectations for.
4. crispy couscous: 5/10. The first bite was good but then it got TOO salty as we got to the centre of the couscous. Would not recommend at all.
5. Shoulder of Lamb (shawarma style): 8/10 this was really good
6. lamb rack: 7/10. This was ok
7. crispy quatayef: 7/10. This was ok","Mixed feelings. Good food but too pricey. Loved the Sujuk bread (9/10) and Fig salad (10/10). Shoulder of Lamb was tasty (8/10). Dim lighting and unhelpful waiter. Sneaky upsell on almonds was annoying. Wouldn't recommend the crispy couscous (5/10). Overall, not sure if I'd return.",1
"First impression of the menu: cheap considering its location and reputation. Portion was generous too.

There's not many tables but you can sit at the bar (we made online reservations, which was easy to get).
The place is noisy, casual, and a little bit upscale. Their menus are made to share so that's a big plus.

Complimentary cheese bun: very cheesy!
Fries: skip it. McDonald's are better.
Burger: delicious! The very well grilled piece of Beaufort cheese elevates this burger to another level. It comes cooked medium (wished I asked for well done).
Iceberg wedge: very unique and the chive sauce tastes like Lays sour cream & chives chips. Big portion too.
Octopus carpaccio: delicious sauce and oil but not worth the price for the few thin slices of octopus.
Famous lemon meringue: we were too full to order it. Next time!","Good first impression. Cheap prices for the location. Generous portions. Noisy, casual vibe with an upscale touch. Easy online reservations. Complimentary cheesy bun is a hit! Skip the fries. Burger is delicious with Beaufort cheese. Unique iceberg wedge with tasty chive sauce.

"Aloette is a must-visit destination for foodies and is sure to delight your taste buds. Its fine dining sister-restaurant ALO upstairs has always been one of the most sought after reservations in Toronto and Aloette upholds a similarly high standard for the food they serve in a more casual diner setting.

The Aloette Burger is a showstopper that is sure to leave you craving for more. The thick melty patty of beaufort cheese that tops a perfectly medium-rare beef burger is what sets it apart. The rest of the burger however keeps things dignified with lettuce and onions. Perfectly executed, without trying too hard.

You'll probably be pretty well fed after their loaf of cheddar brioche bread on top of whatever you ordered (everything sure to be good), but don't leave without having their Lemon Meringue Pie. It is a perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess that will take your taste buds over the top.

Not surprisingly Aloette is listed in the Michelin guide and ALO is honoured with a star, but any local will tell you that they were one of our favourites long before Michelin decided to pay a visit to Toronto.",Must-visit for foodies. Casual vibe with fine dining quality. Aloette Burger is amazing with melty beaufort cheese and perfect medium-rare beef. Cheddar brioche bread is a great start. Don’t miss the Lemon Meringue Pie—perfectly sweet and tangy. Michelin recognized but loved by locals first.,1
"The best meal I had on my visit to Toronto. The staff here does a good job at keeping some tables open for walk in, which is always appreciated. We did call to make a reservation - impression at first walk in - it's an upsaclediner feel, which is what they're going for. Aloette is from the same group as Alo, started by Michelin-starred chef Patrick Kriss in 2015.

When we walked in, I didn't realize we had made a reservation at the bar (it's a diner top) and since we were celebrating an early birthday meal, we opted to sit in a booth and were told we had a time limit. That said, we got to looking at the menu and it's pretty tight so we made some choices. My sister who I was with has a dairy allergy and they were so great, they even let us try the scallop sauce - which was a koji butter.

I love French food and I love diner food, and I wasn't expecting asian fusion! Our waitress Lee was AMAZING - she knew we had the time constraint so she got us ordering. The complimentary bread service is ALWAYS appreciated, and I liked the cheesy bread.

We shared for the starters: The 'Nduja Stuffed Olive Skewer - which has adouli sausage and halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri, omg it was such a delicious little bite; East Coast Oysters with tiger's milk mignonette (bury me in this mignonette); Salmon Tartare on shiso leaf, nori aioli, dashi pearl (it was the least favorite dish); and the Octopus Carpaccio - romesco, almond, cherry tomato. I will never forget this Octopus Carpaccio, the romesco with the almond gave it a flavor of salsa macha and I was literally licking the plate.

Then for entree, I got the Aloette Burger with the cheese on the side (it is a HEAVY burger, and I actually liked that the cheese was on the side). The waitress was so great and veered me away from the tempting Wagyu Truffle Burger -- you have to work up to the heaviness. The other disappointing item - the fries. If you are going to charge $10 for a side of fries, they better be amazing. They tasted almost stale, but no matter bc everything else was amazing. My sister got a half portion of the Aloette Fried Chicken, and I was upset how good this was. We were poo-pooing the idea of ordering this because it was asian fusion: yuzu honey, takuan, hot sauce, bibb lettuce - but the hot sauce, a homemade buffalo-esque was amazing.

Now their wine menu, I was expecting a lot of natural wine, but it was tight. They do have organic wines here but the glass of Beaujolais was average, and I LOVE Beaujolais.

The pi�ce de r�sistance is the Lemon Meringue Pie -- it's $15 a slice which is a STEAL. This pie is like crack. We obsessed over every single bite -- I can't tell you how good this is. Fluffy meringue, and crisp acid lemon and a delightful graham cracker bite. We loved it so much, we even got one to go. And I will tell you, it was just as good at home!

They do brunch and are open for lunch on Fridays. I loved this restaurant, it was higher end food but not the fluff with the diner feel. The staff was so kind and they have a cutie bathroom down the stairs that felt really high end!","Best meal in Toronto! Great staff and open for walk-ins. Upscale diner vibe. Amazing 'Nduja Stuffed Olive Skewer and unforgettable Octopus Carpaccio. Aloette Burger was heavy but good; disappointing fries. Loved the Lemon Meringue Pie, a must-try! Kind service and unique atmosphere. Highly recommend!",1
"So after hearing all about it, we went there this past week and were fairly disappointed.
We were received with a lot of warmth and the service was no doubt impeccable.
But the food was a disappointment. We have had much better French cuisine before.
The speciality drinks were just ehhh! The O&O - I didn't order a second drink.
The broccoli, which was recommended by the server, was so heavy. Maybe because it was deep fried. The carpaccio was average. The scallops were ok as well. The agnolotti wasn't bad.
The best item was the tuna tartar.
Even the bread tasted slightly burned and salty.
Sorry to say, I Just wasn't impressed much.
Will I go there again? -probably not. Will try some other place.
Even the dessert was not good. The hazelnut cake was dry. Maybe it just wasn't their day.",Disappointed overall. Warm welcome and impeccable service. Food didn't impress; had better French cuisine. Specialty drinks were lackluster. Best dish was the tuna tartar. Broccoli was heavy and deep-fried. Carpaccio and scallops were average. Agnolotti was decent. Bread was burned and salty. Dry hazelnut cake for dessert. Probably won't return.,1
"My group of friends and I went to this restaurant with high expectations. The service was well done with complimentary coat check. Our table had four people and we ordered the special roasted pork with foie gras, cornish hen, organic salmon, scallop tostada, beef tartare, fried smelts, a bottle of cava, aperol spritz and ""the fresh number"" cocktail.

We started our night on a high note with the aperol spritz (not on the menu but you can order it) and ""the fresh number"" cocktail. ""The fresh number"" was not as good and was watered down. We followed with the starters which included scallop tostada, beef tartare and fried smelts. Our waitress helped us with this selection but we found them not as good as she described. The scallop tostadas come in a set of 3 and was pretty saucy. The beef tartare was also loaded with sauce so it tasted more like a burger with big mac sauce. And the fried smelts were pretty well seasoned and were topped with deep fried jalape�o pieces.

For our mains, two of us shared the special, which was the foie gras roasted pork (a favourite of our waitress). The pork chop was a fairly large piece and is shareable but it was greasy and fatty. There were no sides to accompany this dish. The organic salmon which was cooked well but not mind blowing in any way. And the cornish hen which was also fairly greasy and heavy and it was accompanied by mushrooms, spinach and a fried egg.

We ended our meal with a bottle of cava which was a nice way to end the night.

From what we ordered the best dishes included the scallop tostada, fried smelts and the cornish hen.

Our bill came out to around ~300, which we felt was a bit pricey for the quality of the food we ate. It was definitely not worth the hype.","High expectations, but underwhelming food. Good service with coat check. Best dishes were scallop tostada, fried smelts, and cornish hen. Cocktails were hit or miss. Pork was greasy, salmon was average. Pricey bill around $300, not worth the hype.",1
"Absolutely delicious! In Toronto for the weekend and so glad we kept checking for reservations. Scored a spot at the bar and was able to sit in the front window. A great way to also watch people on the street.

Things start out with a tasty little amuse bouche - a bit sized cheese bread with jalape�o (I missed the actual description). I wasn't thrilled to order a ""chopped salad"" but this isn't you're average chop - its full of fresh flavor and truly unique. The spicy ceviche was also a top choice since it truly different from any ceviche I've ever had. Certainly no complaints about the truffle gnudi or chickpea fritter either.

Service was incredibly welcoming and walked us through each dish. Will definitely make a stop back on my next trip to try more dishes.",Absolutely delicious! Great vibe at the bar with a window view. Tasty amuse bouche with cheese bread and jalapeño. Unique and flavorful chopped salad. Spicy ceviche is a must-try. Loved the truffle gnudi and chickpea fritter. Welcoming service. Will return for more dishes!,1
"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! I've come here a couple times and they nail everything from the food to service, all in a cozy casual atmosphere.

You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes, though there are some standouts for sure including the chopped salad, spicy ceviche, korean inspired burger, chickpea fritter, brussel sprouts, and sticky bun. But really everything is great. On our latest trip I went with a big group and Rasa was super accommodating to every dietary restriction (thanks Paige and Ken!) and everyone was super happy with our dinner.

The food itself is not pretentious at all which I really love - it's simple, quality ingredients, which have been truly elevated. Everything you eat pops with flavours and they do a beautiful job harmonizing different types of flavours together to create explosiveness in every bite.

Can't wait to come back here!","One of my favorites in Toronto! Cozy vibe. Great service. Standout dishes: chopped salad, spicy ceviche, Korean burger, chickpea fritter, brussel sprouts, sticky bun. Simple, high-quality ingredients with explosive flavors. Super accommodating for dietary restrictions. Can't wait to return!",1
"Rasa got a wonderful rustic cabin vibe going, and it pairs well with their flavourful menu.

The ceviche was one of the best I've had; the Thai flavours were perfectly balanced and the seafood was incredibly fresh. And the chickpea fritters were the perfect accompaniment, with just the right amount of crunch and a delicious sauce that had my taste buds dancing with joy. The short rib and sunchokes were delicious, but the beef was definitely a bit overcooked.

The attention to detail in every dish was simply incredible. Each plate was a work of art that tasted just as good as it looked. I could tell that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into every element, from the presentation to the flavors and textures.

And I have to give a special shoutout to the service team at Rasa. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely seemed to care about making our dining experience the best it could be.

Overall, I cannot recommend Rasa highly enough. The food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and the overall experience is definitely well worth your money!",Great rustic cabin vibe. Exceptional ceviche with balanced Thai flavors and fresh seafood. Crunchy chickpea fritters with delicious sauce. Short rib was tasty but slightly overcooked. Beautifully presented dishes. Attentive and caring service. Highly recommend!,1
"came here to celebrate my birthday. The cocktails are delicious, recommend passionfruit margarita. They are tapas style, the prices may make you think you are getting an entree size but they are meant for sharing and is small portion size. They were accommodating of dietary concern and try their best to work around it or offer you an alternative. The place is packed, very little spacing between tables. I was less than an arm length from the different group next to me, if you get up to use the washroom the other person has to move or you will be touching. it was too close and made everyone in our table and the other table uncomfortable. We ordered a number of items from the menu. Truffle gnudi, steak tartare and duck confit was our favourites. However after we got home we got a stomache, it might have been the tartare, the only person who didnt have the stomache did not have the tartare. I also do not recommend the ceviche, we had high hopes for it, but the fish did not taste right. We were told it's probably the seasoning, but something just was off. A week later, i tried a different restaurant and had their sea bream also saw and it definitely tasted better and not spoiled.
- brussel sprouts $16
- truffle gnudi $24 (there are 4 pieces of ghnochi)
- spicy ceviche $18
- steak tartare $28
- duck confit $28
- rasa burger $21
","Celebrated my birthday here. Delicious cocktails, especially the passionfruit margarita. Tapas style, small portions meant for sharing. Accommodating staff with dietary concerns. Packed place, very close seating made it uncomfortable. Favorites were truffle gnudi, steak tartare, and duck confit. However, we got stomach issues after, possibly from the tartare. Ceviche was disappointing. Prices: brussel sprouts $16, truffle gnudi $24, ceviche $18, steak tartare $28, duck confit $28, rasa burger $21.",1
"2.5 stars - and this review is difficult for me to write because I have tons of mixed feelings about this place.

I was really, really looking forward to going to Rasa and I finally went to have dinner with three other friends. After having a quick look at the different small plates they were offering, we decided to go for ""The Experience"", a special menu that allows you to try 9 of the dishes (they select these for you) for 69 bucks without tax.

The octopus plate and the duck leg really stood out for me - delicious and beautifully presented plates... they really know how to play around with different flavour tones and textures. But overall... the portions felt sooooo wrong. I think going for ""The Experience"" option was our mistake, as we only got 9 very small plates to be shared among the four of us. Is the amount of food they serve not proportional to the amount of people having dinner...?

Basically, we paid around 330 bucks for 9 small plates shared between 4 people - meaning each of them were valued at around 35 dollars. And again, the individual portion was a little bit more than a tablespoon for some of the plates - probably one of the worst size / value ratios I've experienced lately. I think the best option would probably be to order one or two tapas for yourself - the meal will be way more satisfying that way.

Rasa, I think you have an excellent menu and the flavours you're offering are innovative, fresh and great. But please, revise the portions and the value of ""The Experience"" so that people don't feel deceived when they leave.
","Mixed feelings about Rasa. Great flavors and presentation, especially the octopus and duck leg. But portions were way too small for the price—$330 for 9 tiny plates for 4 people. Not worth it. Better to order a couple of tapas instead. Would rate 2.5/5.",1
"A very popular local favourite in the area of Koreatown. The day I went was particularly chilly and the queue wasn't as long but still had to wait around 15 mins as there's very limited seating. We came around 5pm a bit before the dinner rush. They have an extensive menu and we decided to get the hot stone bibimbap, spicy beef soup and the seafood pancake.

Bibimbap: Great sizzling bowl of bibimbap. Their sauce isn't too spicy, more so sweet. The portions for the meat were generous and so were the rest of the toppings.

Yukgaejang: I requested for spice level to be less spicy and it was the perfect amount for me. It was a great soup for the chilly winter day to fill you up. The soup had a lot of flavour and tasted quite delicious. Good amounts of shredded beef.

Seafood pancake: Basically every table had this pancake, so we decided to get the popular appetizer. It's really crispy and had a lot of variety of seafood. The sauce with the pancake was good too. I ended up bringing some home as leftovers.

Delicious food and affordable prices especially in this economy. The restaurant is always busy so expect a wait-time to get seated (especially with large groups the wait will take longer). The service was quite quick and the waitresses were nice. You get a cash discount if you decide to pay in one bill. Overall, I would come back again to try out their other dishes, the only downside is just the wait-time here.","Local favorite in Koreatown. Short 15 min wait. Delicious hot stone bibimbap with sweet sauce and generous meat portions. Great Yukgaejang, perfect spice level for a chilly day. Crispy seafood pancake, a must-try. Affordable prices. Quick service. Will come back, just expect a wait.",0
"one of my go-to eateries in the Korean town
There are a lot of Korean restaurants in Toronto Korean town, why did I like this one over the others? because it is cheap and delicious.
must order: seafood pancake
we have been to this place many times, and this place always has a long lineup during its lunch/dinner time. this place is very small, not so many tables, however, the staff is friendly. it mostly serves home-cooking Korean food.
the portion is good and I really like the seafood pancake, almost every table orders it. also, it has bbq stoves, and apparently, this place is also famous on social media for its Korean bbq. even though i have not tried it, it seems like a good option for a large group.
the wait time would be long if you come in a large group during busy hours.","One of my go-to spots in Korean town. Cheap and delicious! Must order the seafood pancake—great portion and popular with everyone. Friendly staff in a small place. Long wait during busy times, especially for large groups. Heard good things about the Korean BBQ too.",1
"I have high standards for Korean food since I been to Korea, as well I have been eating Korean food my whole life.

Most Korean food places arent as authentic as the ones from Korea but that's understandable.

The food here are very very close to being authentic, one of the best places for Korean food in Toronto. If you go please ask for recommendations.

Price is amazing, it ended being under 20 bucks for 5 of us each. You can't find this fair prices high quality Korean food else where in Toronto.

They don't take reservations, first come first serve. Line ups are longer than an hour during busy hours","High standards for Korean food. This place is very close to authentic. One of the best in Toronto. Great recommendations. Amazing price—under $20 for 5! No reservations, expect long lines.",1
"I had the Sizzing Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes, which came with a side of rice but no side dishes.

The dish tasted so mediocre. It's beef sliced hot pot style stir fried with rice cakes and store bought Korean BBQ sauce. I also didn't feel the Korean BBQ sauce complimented this cut of beef well, given the beef slices were thin and soaked up too much of the sauce. The sauce itself was too sweet.

If you're going to order something at Jin Dal Lae, perhaps don't order the Sizzling Plate","Mediocre dish. Had the Sizzling Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes, but the beef was too thin and soaked in overly sweet sauce. Skip this one at Jin Dal Lae.",1
"VERY Disappointed.
This is an updated review. I would take back my my previous 5-star review posted a year ago.

I placed an order from Ubereats around 7:15pm, then the APP notified me at 8:00pm that the order got cancelled.

During these 45 minutes, I heard NOTHING from the restaurant, not even an Explanation. I wouldn't even find out if it wasn't the app notification. I could have ordered from another restaurant if they told me ahead of time.

I tried twice to call them, and finally the owner picked up the phone said she cancelled it bcuz they were too busy and couldn't prepare my food, not showing a slightest bit of regret that they value their customers. It took them 45 MINUTES to realize that they were too busy to prepare 2 stews and 1 Japchae, what a joke.

I've been to this restaurant since their first day opened, I ate in the restaurant and ordered from ubereats/foodora thousands of times, referred my friends and family to come, rated them high on social media cuz at the beginning they were doing a great job but not many people came and I'd love to see them survive in the neighborhood.

Now I'm really disappointed. Such a waste of time.",Very disappointed. Poor communication. Order cancelled after 45 min with no notice. Owner seemed indifferent. Used to love this place but not anymore. A waste of time.,1
"So flavorful and fresh!

The tacos are expensive but huge - one could be a light meal, two was a little too much, so one plus chips could set you straight.

We ordered one of the yellowfin tuna + shrimp tacos whose name started with a G. It was really interesting because the tuna was ground and tasted almost like pork carnitas... but delicious either way. I also ordered a mushroom and nopal taco which came with guac and a halloumi- esque salty fried cheese to be filling, but I could barely finish it.

The tortilla chips were freshly cooked and flavorful.

Logistics:
- indoor seating only
- CASH ONLY
- limited street parking nearby but transit accessible
- filling vegetarian taco option but not sure if tortillas are corn/GF, need to ask","Super flavorful and fresh! Huge tacos, one is a light meal. Yellowfin tuna and shrimp taco was unique and tasty. Mushroom and nopal taco was filling with great guac and cheese. Freshly cooked tortilla chips were a highlight. Indoor seating only and cash only. Limited parking, but transit accessible.",1
"A Toronto crowd favourite spot for tacos.

When you're in the Kensington Market area, you can't not stop by at Seven Lives, as it's a Toronto staple. Over the years they've moved to a larger space across the street of where they use to be located. The space has ample standing tables, fans, and a bigger space in general for the amount of people that come get tacos here. Their prices have increased quite a bit over the years, as did everything else in this economy now a days. I always opt for their gobernador or fish taco. This time I got their gobernador which is a taco that comes with smoked tuna, grilled shrimps and topped with ooey gooey cheese. You can add your own salsa on the side, they have mild, medium and hot. The gobernador is always a great hit and so tasty - also what they're known for. So definitely give this one a try.

It's quick service/ quick meal, so you're in and out of the taco shop pretty quickly. Every Toronto tourists definitely comes here when they're in town.","Toronto taco staple. Great vibe and larger space. Love the gobernador taco with smoked tuna and grilled shrimp, topped with cheese. Quick service, perfect for a fast meal. A must-try in Kensington Market!",1
"It's a shame that it took me years to finally visit this joint, but I'm so glad I did! I was expecting a lot more of a ""hole in the wall"" type of shop, but it's more spacious than I expected. Let's taco 'bout it (sorry for the pun haha):

- Fave tacos were the pollo (chicken) and baja fish. So flavourful, moist, and perfectly balanced with the toppings. Didn't even need to add extra salsa. Baja fish is my standard way of evaluating tacos - this fish was thicc, plump, and perfectly fried with a light batter. The pollo taco was also delicious and practically spilled out of the taco.
- Server recommended the carnitas and gobernador (smoked tuna), but I didn't love these as much. The carnitas were a bit dry, visually very grey, and could've used some more toppings & salsa. The gobernador was flavourful and not fishy at all, but I thought the flavour profile was a bit too flat. The shrimp helped balance it out, but I think I just wanted pico de gallo or crema - something to just brighten it up more.
- Service: quick
- Atmosphere: no seating available, but there's a couple of tall tables/counter space to eat. Can get VERY hectic (so order takeout if you want to eat in more peace). Not the cleanest shop though. Floors were sticky, and because they're so busy, spills/dropped food doesn't get cleaned up that often","Finally tried this place! Spacious vibe, but hectic. Loved the pollo and baja fish tacos—flavorful and moist. Quick service. Carnitas were dry and gobernador was flat. Not the cleanest spot, but worth a visit!",1
"Let me start by saying that the Tacos tasted great, but whats the point if you can't even eat them properly?

1) There is no eating space whatsoever, the place has 4 chairs and one table, there is a table on the side which you won't be able to use if your shorter than 5'5 anyways

There are two possible ways of eating these tacos most of the time:
i) Take it outside and eat it standing
Ii) Take it home and eat it there

The expectation is that you either eat it standing while the tacos drip everywhere, or you go home and eat the soggy cold stuff.

2) Cash only, i would have understood if they were just starting out, but they are an established business and I see no reason for them being cash only anymore.

I don't know, i feel old writing this review as these things may have not bothered me in my college days but they are a deal breaker for me now.","Great tasting tacos, but no space to eat. Only 4 chairs and one table. Have to eat outside or take home soggy tacos. Cash only policy is frustrating for an established place. Deal breakers for me now.",1
"You cannot go too wrong with tacos, but this was underwhelming.

Expect a long, semi disorganized line to order and then a long, disorganized wait for your food. They were sold out of stuff when we got there at 2:30 pm. Oddly, they sell guacamole but it does not come with chips. What's the point?

Standing room only to eat there (no seats) and the tacos were nothing special. I don't get the popularity.","Underwhelming tacos. Long, disorganized wait. No chips with guacamole. Standing room only. Not worth the hype.",1

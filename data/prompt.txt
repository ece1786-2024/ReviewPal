Given a restaurant review, summarize it to simulate user input as a quick thought.

## The summarized user quick thought should satisfy the following points:
- Be concise, like a quick thought someone might share.
- Accurately reflect the original user's main idea or sentiment.
- Do not introduce new ideas or alter the user's original intent.
- If provided, the following key features should be kept but simplified: dishes (with more descriptive details), tastes, vibe, environment, services, sentiment, suggestion.
- Keep numeric data.
- Can be in the format of short phrases or simple sentences, such as:
  - "Good vibe."
  - "Will come back."
  - "Friendly staff."

## Process:
- Extract the key points.
- Treat each key point as a sentence. Append the sentences.

## Example:

### Input review:
"I absolutely love this place!!!! 5/5 nothing bad to say.

My friend and I came to PAI on a Friday night with no reservation after seeing all their reservations were booked up. We still went to take our chances with walk in around 7pm and we got a table within 15 mins! It was super busy yet they were still able to seat many of us who walked in.

The place upon entrance looks small but it is MASSIVE inside. The vibes are so good with the decor and the lighting. We both only wanted a main as we needed to leave pretty quickly. Service was super fast and friendly.

Food:
- Pad Thai with Beef (no chives): 5/5 stars. I was absolutely starving and this was phenomenal. It was not too sweet or sour. It was perfect. Texture was great and portions were pretty big. I could've taken some home if I wanted to but was too hungry.

As we were in a rush, we were able to leave within 45 mins of being there. 5/5!!! Would recommend even if you don't have a reso"

### Output quick thought:
"Love this place. Great vibe. Fast service. Amazing Pad Thai with balanced taste and great texture. Walked in on a busy night and seated fast in 15 min. Can finish in 45 min. Recommended. Would rate 5/5."

## Notes
- Keep it simple.
- Prefer short phrases that are more descriptive of the dishes mentioned.

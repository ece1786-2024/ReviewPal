Gyubee Japanese Grill offers an enjoyable all-you-can-eat experience with an impressive mix of Korean and Japanese dishes. The variety of sides complements the quality meats on offer, making the meal satisfying. The service is top-notch, with attentive staff ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Prices are fair for weekday lunches, but be prepared for a higher check during weekends and evenings. While it's predominantly smooth, payment can be tricky as the place only takes debit or cash, and groups under six can't reserve—a downside on a busy Friday night when waits are likely. However, if you're not in a rush and it's a quieter day, Gyubee's lively atmosphere and good selection make it worth another visit. Despite minor inconveniences, it stands out in service and value.

Gyubee Japanese Grill is a fun spot to dive into an all-you-can-eat feast with both Asian flair. Selena crafts juicy meats accompanied by tasty sides that make the meal complete. The staff is genuinely friendly and always making sure you've got everything you need. If you hit up Gyubee during a weekday lunch, the prices aren't bad; evenings and weekends can get pricier though. Just a heads-up, they only accept debit or cash, and you can't book a table for less than six people. So on bustling Fridays, expect a bit of a wait—but if vibes are low-key, the energetic buzz and amazing food make it a great pick. Sure, a few hiccups like the payment have existed, but overall, it’s a place you'd be happy to swing by again.

I recently had the opportunity to dine at Gyubee Japanese Grill in Markham, where crowds are a sign of their enticing offerings. The wait stretched to about 1.5 hours, typical for a bustling weekend, but the vibrant atmosphere spoke of its deserved popularity. I found the check-in process could use some streamlining, as the bustling vibe translated into a somewhat haphazard entry experience.

Once seated, the delightful aromas of grilling delicacies quickly took center stage. I indulged in the perfectly tender miso-marinated rib steak and revelled in the rich notes of the sweet soy short ribs. The sausage offerings were a savory surprise, authentically rich and wholly satisfying.

The team's attentiveness, evident from their smiles and quick service tackling a packed house efficiently, added to the delightful meal experience. While I wholeheartedly recommend a visit for the amazing food and warm service, timing outside peak hours would enhance the enjoyment even further.

Gyubee Japanese Grill in Markham is a real hotspot, always bustling with people. Expect longer waits; we had a 1.5-hour wait on a busy weekend. Check-in was a bit hectic. When we were finally seated, the delicious smell of grilling meats was worth it. I absolutely loved the miso-marinated rib steak; it was so tender. The sweet soy short ribs were packed with flavor and the sausages were a tasty surprise. The servers were great, managing the crowd with smiles and quick service. The atmosphere was vibrant, and while the food and service were top-notch, try coming during less busy times for a more relaxed visit.

Gyubee Japanese Grill offers an impressive and all-encompassing BBQ experience. The standout feature is undoubtedly the incredible meat selection, featuring tender and flavorful cuts like kalbi and miso marinated prime rib that made the grilling interactive and satisfying. While the seafood options felt slightly limited, the meat more than made up for it. The restaurant's popularity is evident with substantial wait times, making reservations essential if you want to bypass the crowds. Dining with my family of three cost $135 this time, which reflects a noticeable increase from last year’s $90. However, each bite justified the price hike with its juicy goodness. Despite being a packed place, the warm and attentive service made me feel welcome, and the casual atmosphere adds to its charm. While keeping leftover clothes odor-free, those powerful exhaust fans still work wonders. Ultimately, heading to Gyubee remains worth every moment in line and every penny spent.

Gyubee Japanese Grill is a fantastic spot for BBQ fans. Their selection of meats is outstanding, with delights like kalbi and miso-marinated prime rib stealing the show.

Trattoria Nervosa welcomes patrons with its cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfectly enhanced by a charming interior that's a nod to southern Italy. The rooftop patio was a lovely setting, adding an open-air touch that many seek. However, my dining experience was marred by lackluster service. The waitress seemed unhappy to be there, and that set a discomforting tone.

When the food finally arrived, it disappointed. The promising oil-rich kale salad was marred by cold chunks of chicken, the pizza crust was more of charcoal than crust, and the steak didn’t improve upon its return from the kitchen—it was just as cold. It's disheartening because the place has clear potential, a proud part of Yorkville since 1996. Their impressive backdrop deserves better execution. I hope management takes strides to turn these odds around. Based on this experience, I'd rate it a 3 out of 5, extending wishes for a memorable next visit version from improved efforts.

Trattoria Nervosa feels like a quaint corner of southern Italy. The rooftop patio's open-air setup was a treat. But the visit took a nosedive with service; our waitress seemed far from happy, giving things an awkward start. The food didn’t help. The kale salad, sadly chilled by clunky chicken pieces, missed the mark. The pizza could have passed for a charcoal sculpture, and even after a rerun, the steak was still as chilly. It’s frustrating since this spot has been treasured in Yorkville since 1996. Such a charming venue should reflect better on the plate. Hopefully, they can step up soon. For now, a 3 out of 5 – waiting for the next visit to be more delightful.

During my recent visit to Trattoria Nervosa with a group of eight, my experience was contrary to its reputed warmth. Our waitress seemed indifferent and inattentive—many seemed to enjoy personalized service, which was certainly lacking for us. It was disappointing to miss out on simple touches like Parmesan and pepper that graced other tables.

On the plate, the meal was a hit-and-miss. The pasta was pedestrian, missing the vibrant flavors I'd expected. In contrast, the mushroom risotto was a standout—creamy with a perfect balance of flavors. Unfortunately, an automatic 20% tip felt undeserving for the service mismatch.

While the setting holds appeal with its lush greenery, the overall experience didn't resonate well. Regrettably, this makes it unlikely for me to revisit.

I recently dined at Trattoria Nervosa with a group of friends and hoped for their famous hospitality, but it fell short for us. Our server barely paid attention, while other tables seemed to enjoy thoughtful service. It was a letdown not to experience simple things like receiving fresh Parmesan and pepper with our meal.  

The food was hit or miss. The pasta was pretty basic, not packed with the flavors I was looking forward to. However, the mushroom risotto really impressed me—rich and deliciously balanced. I wasn’t sure a 20% tip, auto-added, was worth it, though, given the service.  

The place looks lovely, with lots of greenery adding charm, but the promises of warmth and welcome didn't come through. Sadly, I don’t see ourselves heading back anytime soon.

Walking into Aux Merveilleux de Fred was like stepping into a charming spot straight out of Paris. The smell of baking bread and pastries was comforting and hard to resist. I relaxed in a snug corner, watching as the bakers crafted their desserts right in front of me. The meringues caught my attention—soft and full of flavor like cherry, hazelnut, and chocolate. They were little clouds of sweet delight, making every bite special. Although the chocolate brioche buns looked good, they didn't quite match the fresh taste of the meringues. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of most items was excellent, making it a visit worth making. I left feeling joyful, as if I'd enjoyed a little slice of French life.

I stumbled upon what I can only describe as a hidden gem, Aux Merveilleux de Fred. The moment I tasted their incredible chocolate meringue, I was hooked. It delivered an exquisite blend of crunch, creaminess, and lightness that's hard to find. My usual love for pain au chocolat was happily reaffirmed here, with a perfect balance of crispy texture and melted chocolate goodness bursting with every bite.

The croissants were equally divine, embodying everything you’d expect from an authentic French bakery. The cafe’s cute and cozy atmosphere made my mocha taste even better, although the limited seating was a slight downside with such a bustling crowd. That said, the energy added charm to the visit. While the breads were slightly dry for my personal taste, the overall experience was truly delightful. It’s always refreshing to encounter consistently high quality in both pastries and service, and I’m eager to return.

I walked into Aux Merveilleux de Fred and tasted chocolate meringue that instantly had me craving more. It’s a perfect dance of crunch and cream. Their pain au chocolat is creamy and crispy just the way I love it; each bite with warm chocolate is pure joy.

Their croissants are spot-on, the real French deal. Sitting in the cozy café, my mocha felt extra comforting despite the crowded space being a tad snug. The buzz of people actually made it all lively. The bread was a bit dry for me, but everything else made up for it. I left the café with happy taste buds and friendly service stealing the show, already planning my next visit.

Aux Merveilleux de Fred offers a charming escape in the heart of Toronto. My visit there was delightful as I savored a mocha that paired perfectly with a freshly baked croissant, delivering that unbeatable flakiness synonymous with genuine French craftsmanship. The highlight, though, was their dark chocolate pastry, rich and enticing with each bite—it was heavenly in every sense.

The patisserie is quaint and beautifully appointed, but it really could use more seating to accommodate the continuous stream of eager patrons looking to relish their delectable selects in-house. Still, the purity of the flavors and the authenticity of everything on offer made it worthwhile. The anticipation of returning to indulge in more of their delicacies, especially their tantalizing brioche, definitely ensures another visit soon.

Aux Merveilleux de Fred is a cozy gem in Toronto. Stopping by was a treat. I enjoyed a mocha with a flaky, buttery croissant that tasted just like in Paris. But the real winner was their dark chocolate pastry—every bite felt like pure bliss.

The shop is adorable, though it can get crowded. A bit more seating would definitely help. Yet, the goodies they whip up are definitely worth a repeat visit. I'm already daydreaming about going back to dive into more treats, especially that mouth-watering brioche.

The pastries at Aux Merveilleux de Fred were disappointingly mixed during my visit. The croissant, widely noted for its buttery essence, felt stale and void of its signature rich taste. Conversely, the brioche stood out beautifully—fluffy, fresh, and contently fulfilling its reputation. Unfortunately, the bread pudding fell short, lacking the indulgence one would expect. The place buzzed with an undeniable popularity but, unfortunately, lacked seating to endure the wait more comfortably. Despite the hustle bustling atmosphere, service felt transactional and curt, missing the warmth familiar at renowned establishments. Overall, an experience that caught both highs in anticipation and lows in certain tastes.

The pastries at Aux Merveilleux de Fred were a hit-and-miss for me. I was bummed to find the croissant less fresh, missing that buttery melt you crave. But I had better luck with the brioche—it was a cloud of fluffiness, just as you'd hope. The bread pudding let me down, though, not as rich as I imagined. The shop draws a big crowd but has nowhere to sit while you wait, which is a bit rough. The staff moved quickly but weren't super friendly, which added to the rushed feel. In short, some treats delighted, while others didn't quite meet the mark.

The elegance of the decor complemented the sweeping vistas, creating a sophisticated atmosphere. Service was polished and attentive; our waiter was both knowledgeable and courteous, ensuring our glasses were always filled and our questions promptly answered.

Marking our 25th anniversary at Canoe felt nothing short of extraordinary. Situated way up on the 54th floor, the sweeping views over Toronto and Lake Ontario turned our dinner into a memorable scene. The place was fancy but still cozy, perfectly setting the mood for our special evening.

Once we stepped in, the staff’s friendliness made a mark. They had a contagious enthusiasm for what they were doing and were great at helping us figure out the menu. Out of everything, the salmon confit was an unforgettable standout—beautifully crafted with flavors that melted in the mouth. A well-chosen selection of wine and bourbon made every taste richer.

Sitting atop the Toronto skyline, Canoe's atmosphere was nothing short of breathtaking, framing a 54th-floor view that's perfect for a special evening. The welcoming staff added warmth and attentiveness throughout the lengthy two-hour dining experience. Impressively presented, the dishes I tried—three curated starters, two mains, and a couple of desserts—illustrated genius in culinary artistry, each plated with a nod to Canada’s diverse heart. The salmon confit in particular stood out, carrying equally the tender texture hoped for, despite a faintness in taste which echoed inconsistently across other protein options. On the agreeably high-end side, the expertise showed off in details, set against hefty-but-predictable portions for the bill of $450—worth every respectful bite for fine dining enthusiasts who won't mind spending extra for such finesse. Ultimately, it scores a revered 4.5/5 for taste with ceiling-high points for the evening itself, leaving sweet memories spun from gilded edges.

With a view that makes you stop and stare from the 54th floor, Canoe is the place for an unforgettable evening. The staff being so welcoming made our whole time feel special. We spent two hours there, diving into a variety of artfully plated dishes. The inspiration from Canadian flavors really shined, particularly in the salmon confit—its melt-in-the-mouth feel was perfect, though its taste sometimes faded a bit compared to other meats. It was on the pricier side at $450, but the craftsmanship in each dish was unmistakable, with portions properly sized. For anyone who's into gourmet experiences, it's worth the splurge. Overall, I'd say it’s a solid 4.5 out of 5 for flavor and leaving with fond memories of the exceptional dining adventure.

Celebrating our anniversary at Canoe was a highlight, thanks mainly to the phenomenal service and breathtaking atmosphere. Nestled on the 54th floor, we admired panoramic views of Toronto that set a stunning backdrop for the evening. Our waiter added significantly to the occasion with his attentive and gracious approach, enhancing the celebration with sincere charm.

However, the food didn’t quite live up to expectations. Opting for the braised lamb shoulder, I found the flavors surprisingly bland given its elevated price. The rest of the meal followed suit, lacking the vibrant taste I’d hoped for. Furthermore, being charged for water without prior notice dampened the experience.

Ultimately, the magical ambiance and stellar service stood out, but the food fell short of the reputation that Canoe holds. For the price, I expected every aspect of our meal to be just as extraordinary as the surroundings and care provided.

Ultimately, while Canoe's atmosphere and staff shone, the food didn't quite match the hype or the cost. For what we paid, I hoped every bite would be as impressive as the surroundings and the care we received.

Maya Bay offers a delightful taste of Thailand with its wide array of Asian dishes. My dining experience was defined by the bold flavors of the Pad Kee Mao and the aromatic, spicy green curry. Both dishes were crafted with precision, just spicy enough to warm the soul without overwhelming the palate. However, the Pad Thai, though a favorite among many, leaned too much on the sour-sweet spectrum for my taste; a touch more spice would have balanced it perfectly.

The restaurant’s casual vibe, set at a cozy corner with views of the bustling street, added to the pleasant experience. I appreciated their thoughtful vegetarian options, although I wish they offered Halal meat to accommodate more diners. The restaurant effortlessly merges a laid-back atmosphere with intricate flavors, making it a worthwhile spot for an authentic Thai food experience.

Both dishes hit the right spot with their heat, enough to spark your taste buds without being too much. On the other hand, the Pad Thai was sweeter and more sour than I care for. A bit more spice would have done the trick. The vibe is relaxed, with a cozy corner spot overlooking busy streets, drawing you in.

Based on a friend's recommendation, I decided to check out Maya Bay, looking forward to the acclaimed dishes. Unfortunately, the visit was disappointing. The Tom Yum Soup, which I eagerly anticipated, leaned heavily on the fishy side, overpowering what should've been a delicate balance of flavors. The saving grace was the crispy pork belly, cooked to a delightful crunch and full of flavors that mirrored authentic Thai cuisine. Sadly, the service aspect didn't help. Throughout our time, the staff felt detached, showing only friendliness after our bill was settled, which left an underwhelming impression. While the restaurant's simple industrial rustic décor seemed charming at first, the overall experience fell short, particularly with how highly it's been rated.

A friend told me to check out Maya Bay, so I walked in with high hopes, excited for their popular dishes. But honestly, things didn't quite hit the mark for me. The Tom Yum Soup, which I was really looking forward to, was too fishy and drowned out the usual nice mix of flavors. Thank goodness for the crispy pork belly! It had just the right crunch and tasted just like a good plate straight from Thailand. Service-wise, not great. The staff seemed distant and only warmed up when it was time to pay, which was a bit off-putting.

The staff ensured a seamless experience, quickly attending to my table despite the bustle of the cozy restaurant. I opted for the Gyu Gyu King Curry, and it did not disappoint. The vast portion was perfect for two, yet its tantalizing aroma enticed me to devour it all myself. The traditional taste was unique, deviating refreshingly from other Japanese curries I've tried; it had a gentler spice profile that brought out the subtle complexities of the beef, cooked to perfect tenderness.

Gyugyuya's curry hits the spot, especially on a cold day. The portions are big enough to leave you feeling satisfied till your next meal. The taste is spot-on, and the rice complements the curry in a really homey kind of way. If you're looking to grab something filling without the wait, this is your go-to.

The staff are on their toes and always greet you with a genuine smile. Even in a small place like this, they make it feel warm despite the breeze blowing in through the door at times. Everything runs smoothly whether you’re eating in or grabbing takeout. For a cozy Japanese meal packed with flavor and friendly service, Gyugyuya is definitely a place I’d revisit when craving something truly tasty and fulfilling.

Gyugyuya offers a delightful interior that immediately catches the eye with its tasteful Japanese-themed decor, creating a relaxing ambiance. The coziness provided a welcoming atmosphere for either a solo visit like mine or a casual outing with a friend. The service lived up to its positive reputation; staff were attentive and courteous, even with a bustling dining area. However, I found the food did not quite meet the expectation set by the lovely decor and great service. Although the portions are generous, and my order was delivered promptly, the flavors, particularly of the Chicken Karaage, were more muted than anticipated. Nonetheless, the welcoming environment made up for the food's shortcomings, providing an enjoyable overall experience. Given my mixed results, I'd be willing to return, possibly attracted again by the ambiance, to explore other menu options.

Walking into Gyugyuya feels like stepping into a little corner of Japan. The decor is all smooth woods and soft lighting. Whether you're on your own or catching up with a pal, this place feels like a snug fit. The staff was on the ball, handling a busy room with smiles and efficiency. Sadly, the food didn't hit the high notes I hoped for. My Chicken Karaage was okay but lacked that punch you expect. Still, with the easy, laid-back vibe luring me in, I'm open to giving their menu another shot just to find that hidden gem.

Gyebee provided an enjoyable dining experience with its lively, welcoming vibe. The service stood out; the staff were genuinely friendly and attentive, making sure our table had everything we needed. The variety of beef options was impressive, and the well-marinated cuts brought out delicious flavors. Grilling at our own table added a fun, interactive element to the meal.

What left a lasting impression, though, was the seasonal pumpkin soup. It was a comforting, flavorful treat that set the tone perfectly for a cozy gathering with friends. However, the seafood could use some improvement, as it didn't quite reach the same standard as the beef.

Despite the bustling atmosphere, Gyebee proves to be a great spot for a fun, relaxed hangout with friends, and we relished every bite.

Gyebee is such a lively place to grab a meal! The atmosphere is really warm and inviting, with friendly staff that make sure you're well taken care of. Trying their beef is a must, especially since they have so many cuts to choose from, all marinated to perfection. Cooking it right at the table is a fun twist!

A standout for me was their seasonal pumpkin soup—so rich and comforting. It was perfect for catching up with friends in a cozy setting. The seafood lagged behind the beef, though; it wasn't quite as good.

Even with the crowd, Gyebee feels like an awesome spot to chill and enjoy great company. Every bite was worth it!

The service was impressively quick and orderly, with staff constantly attentive without being intrusive. Their unique all-you-can-eat barbecue allows guests to indulge in a diverse range of meats, each piece tenderly sliced and boasting top quality cuts. The prime steak and neatly marbled briskets were particular standouts, each bite bursting with flavor from their exquisite marinades.

Gyebee offers an immersive dining experience with its all-you-can-eat, two-hour BBQ concept. The menu is a feast for the senses, especially if you're a fan of Japanese and Asian flavors. I particularly enjoyed everything infused with their soy marinade, which packed just the right amount of savory richness into each bite. The chicken thighs were succulent, perfectly charred, and burst with flavor. 

The Ajillo was a highlight, with a spicy kick that added depth to the meal and surprised my palate. Each dish was accentuated with a table sauce that seemed to enhance the cod fish essence of the meat, making every morsel unforgettable and leaving me eager for the next bite.

Overall, for the value and taste alone, I highly recommend Gyebee. Plus, being able to cook at your own pace ensures an interactive and exciting dining adventure that stands head and shoulders above the typical restaurant experience.

Gyebee's all-you-can-eat BBQ is a dream for anyone who loves Japanese and Asian-style dishes. I was really into their soy-marinated selections; they tasted savory with each bite. The chicken thighs were tender and nicely grilled, a real treat!

I was quite excited to try Gyubee, known for its all-you-can-eat BBQ experience. However, my visit turned frustrating. Upon arrival, we were quoted a 60-minute wait time but ended up lingering over two agonizing hours before being told of an additional 20-minute delay. The staff's attitude was the cherry on top, as they seemed impatient and dismissive during our queries about our table. Their behavior made the atmosphere feel unwelcoming, which was not what I had anticipated. Unfortunately, it tainted the prospect of savoring any of their renowned prime steak or garlic shrimp. I wasted valuable time on a long-awaited dining outing and that makes me hesitant to return. A piece of advice: book far in advance and brace yourself for unclear waitlist procedures if you choose to visit during peak hours.

I was pumped to finally check out Gyubee for some all-you-can-eat BBQ. But the experience was a letdown. When we got there, they said it'd be an hour wait. Instead, we stood around for more than two hours only to hear we needed to sit tight for another 20 minutes. The staff didn't help—seemed like they were tired of our questions, which made the place feel cold. The whole thing left a sour taste, so I didn't get to dig into their famous prime steak or garlic shrimp. Lost hours on a night I was really looking forward to, so not itching to go back. Heads up: make sure you book waaay in advance and be ready for messy wait times if you head there during peak hours.

Dining at Dear Saigon was a mixed experience. While the food undeniably hit the mark with its taste, there were a few disappointments. The authenticity of the Vietnamese flavors shone brightly in dishes like their Pho noodle soup, exuding rich aromas and deep-brewed flavors. It felt like briefly being whisked away to Saigon through taste.

However, the experience took a turn when it came to dessert. I ordered flan and expected something as beautifully presented as their signature Vietnamese coffee. To my surprise, it arrived in a plain takeout box, dampening the overall appeal. While it's clear Dear Saigon invests heavily in crafting their main courses with care, it would benefit them to apply the same finesse to dessert presentation. This small aspect overshadowed an otherwise enjoyable meal, taking away the charming effect they strive to achieve from start to finish.

My recent visit to Mercatto left much to be desired. Unfortunately, the mains arrived just lukewarm after an inexplicable wait, making the gnocchi and pappardelle feel as if they'd taken a turn in the microwave. The braised ragu lacked its usual vibrancy, and my skepticism was raised. Thankfully, the appetizers modestly redeemed the meal. The crispy calamari was a hit with its perfect texture paired delightfully with the vibrant red pepper sauce, while the truffle crema fries hinted at potential culinary prowess.

The real letdown was the service. Our server seemed to fall off the radar entirely after taking our initial order, never checking in. Bland drinks paired with inattentive service only amplified the frustration, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste of disappointment. Despite Mercatto's appealing location and menu options, my experience here wouldn't entice me back anytime soon.

My latest outing to Mercatto was underwhelming. After what felt like an unnecessary wait, my mains showed up lukewarm, almost like they'd been reheated quickly. The gnocchi and pappardelle didn't shine, and the ragu lacked flavor. But the starters were a saving grace. The crispy calamari nailed it with its spot-on texture and zingy red pepper sauce, and the truffle fries showed glimpses of good cooking.

The biggest flop was the service. Our server disappeared after jotting down our order, never to check on us again. Pair that with tasteless drinks and it cranked up the annoyance. Even with Mercatto’s nice spot and varied menu, it's not calling me back for a return visit anytime soon.

Pig Out BBQ offered a down-to-earth southern BBQ experience that truly captures the essence of smoky dining. I shared the six-rib dinner, perfectly complemented by crispy fries, tangy coleslaw, and crunchy pickles. The ribs had a marvelous smoky taste and tender texture, but they were on the dry side without sauce, which might not be ideal for those who prefer juicier cuts. However, for enthusiasts of smoky BBQ flavors, this could very well be a treat. The fries were a highlight, achieving a satisfying crispiness that paired well with the meal.

Pig Out BBQ gives off a relaxed, southern-style vibe with its barbecue. I split a six-rib platter with friends, which came alongside fries, coleslaw, and pickles, offering a nice mix of flavors. The ribs had a nice smoky flavor, but were a bit dry without sauce, which might not suit everyone’s taste. If you’re into that deep, smoked BBQ essence, though, you’d likely enjoy these. The fries deserve a mention too – super crispy and well-seasoned, making them a solid side. Space inside is cozy, but the friendly staff makes you feel right at home. While my taste in ribs leans towards juicier cuts, I’d still recommend giving Pig Out BBQ a shot, especially if you’re all about that smoky, low-and-slow-cooked charm.

Feasting at Pig Out BBQ was a true delight! I couldn't resist the Jr. Pig Out Platter at $46.95—what an enormous spread, perfectly sized for sharing with 2-3 people. The brisket was mouthwateringly tender, full of smoky flavor that just hits the spot. As for the ribs, they melted off the bone and thrilled my tastebuds with each bite. 

While the wings were decent, I felt they could use a splash more sauce to bring them alive. However, the sides certainly made up for it. The gooey mac 'n' cheese was comfort food at its finest, and the sweet potato fries offered a lovely mix of crispy and sweet. Adding to the charm was the friendly staff, making me feel welcomed the moment I stepped in. This place delivers big, hearty flavors, which left me highly recommending it for any BBQ lover out there!

Eating at Pig Out BBQ was fantastic. I ordered the Jr. Pig Out Platter for $46.95—it’s huge and perfect for sharing with 2-3 people. The brisket was super tender with a smoky flavor that was just right. The ribs practically fell off the bone and were incredibly tasty.

The wings were okay, but they could use more sauce for extra flavor. The sides made up for it, though. The mac 'n' cheese was wonderfully cheesy and comforting, and the sweet potato fries were both crispy and sweet. The staff was really friendly, greeting me warmly as soon as I arrived. If you're a BBQ fan, you've got to check this place out for its big, hearty flavors!

Stepping into Pig Out BBQ, the aroma was promising, yet the meal fell a tad short of expectations. The ribs, often the centerpiece in barbeque joints, didn't pack the smoky punch I hoped for and came out a bit dry. Similarly, the brisket disappointed as it was cut with the grain, making it a struggle to chew. The mac and cheese was decent, thankfully sidelined the over-processed Velveeta and leaned more towards a comforting homemade flavor.

However, what stood out was the warm and friendly demeanor of the staff. They seemed genuinely enthusiastic, adding a welcoming touch to the average culinary experience.

While certain dishes seemed to lack the depth of flavor, the casual charm of the place and pleasant staff made it still a worthwhile visit. Maybe with another visit, they'll hit that BBQ sweet spot.

Walking into Pig Out BBQ, I was hit with a mouthwatering smell, but the meal wasn't as exciting. The ribs, which I'd expected to be the highlight, missed the rich, smoky taste I love and were a bit dry. Also, the brisket was tough because it was sliced wrong. On a better note, the mac and cheese tasted homemade which was delightful. The standout, though, was the staff. They were so welcoming and easy-going, really brightening up the experience. While the food didn't wow me, the friendly atmosphere and staff made the visit pleasant. I might try again next time, hoping they nail the BBQ flavors.

Pig Out BBQ near UofT is a gem for students looking for hearty meals on a budget. I tried the Pig Out Platter, and it checked all the boxes for an unforgettable BBQ experience. Laden with tender ribs, juicy wings, and savory brisket, the platter's generous portions are perfect for sharing with friends; it easily feeds four to five people. It's a culinary adventure that evokes the best of Southern BBQ right here in Toronto. 

If you're after something more manageable, the Piglet Platter doesn’t disappoint, either. Its smaller size doesn’t compromise on taste or satisfaction. The laid-back atmosphere suits any casual night out, and while it may be a bit pricier than typical student spots, the delicious, melt-in-your-mouth BBQ and cheerful, attentive staff make it worth every penny. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic, honest barbecue.

Pig Out BBQ near UofT is perfect for students who want tasty meals without breaking the bank. I grabbed the Pig Out Platter, and it didn’t leave anything to be desired. Loaded with tender ribs, wings dripping with flavor, and savory brisket, the dish’s big portions easily fill up four or five. It’s a barbecue dream, giving Southern tastes right in Toronto.

If you’re palate’s calling for a smaller bite, the Piglet Platter satisfies all the same. It’s not any less tasty, just a bit less to handle. With its relaxed vibe, the place is great for an easygoing hangout. Although prices are slightly higher than typical student joints, the food's super flavor and the warm, friendly team truly make it worth it. Definitely a must-try for anyone with a true barbecue itch.

I was drawn to Pig Out BBQ thanks to their promising array of BBQ classics and left longing for another round of their beef brisket sandwich. Each bite melded tender, flavorful brisket with just the right hint of smokiness. Sure, it leaned on the fatty side, but that's almost a comfortable reminder of honest BBQ fare. Their garlic-infused wings were impressively juicy, delighting in subtle bursts of garlic that kept every bite interesting. The ribs, though not my personal highlight, still carried that recognizable respect for a good rub. Though subdued from the outside, I found the spacious and freshly renovated interior surprising and pleasantly inviting. It's the kind of place where eclectic with friends don’t even scratch the surface—a napkin-laden joy filled with happy indulgences!

My visit to Gusto 101 began delightfully with their crispy focaccia paired with a delightfully creamy burrata that set a promising tone for the evening. The star of my meal was undoubtedly the Mafalde ai Funghi. This pasta dish, adorned with a luscious truffle cream sauce and a special blend of mushrooms, left me sated and eager for more. Equally impressive was the Casarecce Al Ragu, where every bite was seeped in rich, hearty flavors.

I was also treated to excellent service; my server ensured my water glass was never empty and promptly catered to every need with graciousness.

Nestled in Old Toronto, Gusto 101 brims with a vibrant vibe perfect for lively gatherings. The moment I walk in, the fun energy is palpable. Starting off, the calamari and arancini delight with their crispiness—definitely worth trying as the starters set a high expectation. The creative spread on the Diavola Pizza promises fresh flavors, yet an unexpected undone touch leaves a greasy coat that overshadows its potential. Meanwhile, the pasta offering sounded inviting but settled a bit heavier than one hopes. Drinks are undoubtedly a highlight; the eclectic bar options feel endless, perfect for unwinding with friends. Service was a journey—it started energetically but sadly dwindled as the evening progressed. Despite providing an ideal spot for casual gatherings over drinks and bites, the food doesn't entirely wow as their drinks menu does.

Lee creates a visually captivating experience with dishes like their famous Singaporean-style slaw and dreamy Top Chef Curry Roasted Chicken vying for top attention. Each plate is impeccably presented, resembling art on a dish, yet it doesn't fully measure up in flavor. I found the cheeseburger spring rolls more photogenic than satisfying. The atmosphere is stylish, its quiet ambiance welcoming for an intimate chat, though perhaps an anomaly amidst reports of weekend crowd noise.

Service was prompt and attentive, considering the animated demeanor of the staff, which lent a festive, albeit slightly overwhelming, tone to my meal. For a dinner here, anticipate funds slipping, as options can quickly elevate expenses; the cost doesn't consistently match the gastronomic adventure marketed. Lee promised intricacy and exuberance, and though it did mostly with style, it delivered modest returns in culinary accomplishment. The evening ended on an even keel, more of a scenic detour than a culinary crescendo.

I visited Lee and was immediately drawn in by the pretty dishes, like their Singaporean slaw and the Top Chef Curry Roasted Chicken. It looked like art, but the flavors didn't quite impress.

The place itself is sleek, and during my visit, it was peacefully quiet—quite the opposite of the noisy weekends I'd heard about.  

The service was quick, with friendly, lively staff making the meal feel festive, although occasionally a bit much.

Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen offers a captivating ambiance with its tropical decor and lively Caribbean tunes. However, my recent visit left me with mixed emotions. The jerk chicken, tender with an enticing smoky flavor, seemed overpriced at $25, especially considering rice and peas came with an additional $7 charge. Despite the fast service and clean environment, the rice fell short; it was disappointingly dry, which slightly diminished the meal's overall appeal. The salad, in contrast, brought a pleasant crunch that stood out positively. While the setting is perfect for a lunch with friends or sipping on the unique Honey Flora cocktail, the quality of the meal didn't fully justify its price in my view, especially knowing there are other options for Jamaican cuisine that offer a better balance in flavor and cost.

Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen is lively with its tropical look and Caribbean music. I had mixed feelings after my recent visit. The jerk chicken was tender with a nice smoky taste but felt pricey at $25, especially since rice and peas were an extra $7. The service was quick, and the place was tidy, but the rice was dry and let the meal down a bit. The salad added a fresh, crunchy contrast and stood out. It's a great spot for hanging out with friends or trying their unique Honey Flora cocktail. However, I thought that given the prices, the meal didn't quite hit the mark, especially since there are other Jamaican spots that offer better flavors for what you pay.

Stepping into Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen feels like being whisked away to a vibrant corner of the Caribbean. The buzzing, island-style atmosphere instantly set the stage for an unforgettable meal. The service was genuinely warm and impressively efficient despite the lively crowd, accommodating us with smiles and quick service.

The star of our meal was undeniably the flavor-packed curry chicken. Each bite was rich and perfectly spiced. The shrimp coconut curry complemented it beautifully, offering a luscious combination of creamy and spicy flavors. However, the honey jerk wings stole the show, with their perfectly crisp exterior and mouth-wateringly sweet-spicy glaze.

Although the prices leaned towards the higher side considering the portions, we were satisfyingly full—a testament to the flavorful depth of each dish. This lively spot in Toronto undoubtedly beckons a return visit!

The culinary experience at Kiin was a delightful mixture of exceptional flavors and artful presentation. Each dish, from the purple dumplings to the homemade green noodles, was a feast for both the eyes and palate. Despite the premium pricing, which reflects the quality and creativity of the menu, I found the investment well worthwhile as every bite was bursting with intricate spices typical of authentic Thai cuisine. The restaurant boasts a charming and contemporary decor, making it an ideal spot for both business lunches and intimate date nights.

However, while the appetizers were admissibly small yet delicious, the table space barely accommodated the family-style dining, which slightly dampened the sharing experience. The evening could have been seamless had the service matched the venue's upscale ambiance. Unfortunately, service interruptions distracted from the overall enjoyment. Still, the stunning tableau each dish presented managed to steal back much of the limelight, securing a mostly pleasant evening.

Even though the prices were on the higher end, each bite was packed with authentic Thai spices, making it feel special.

Walking into Kiin, I was immediately taken by the elegant decor and stylish furniture that sets a cozy ambiance, perfect for what I hoped would be a delightful experience. Unfortunately, once seated, my expectations began to waver. While the staff handled transactions smoothly and were friendly enough, it didn't make up for the true letdown—breakfast. The supposedly traditional Thai breakfast proved disappointing. The eggs, plainly unseasoned, paired with bland sausages failed to charm the taste buds and left much to be desired. The Thai tea, instead of delivering a delicate balance, was overwhelmingly sweet. Despite the Michelin recognition and much-lauded appearance, the flavors didn't quite invite a return visit.

Byblos delights with outstanding Middle Eastern cuisine and an elegant, trendy atmosphere. The spacious setting encouraged communal enjoyment with my group. We started with beautifully plated hummus and an enchanting pear & arugula salad, perfect for sharing.

The octopus at Byblos was a standout, bursting with a perfect blend of spices and maintaining a moist texture that left a delightful aftertaste. Pairing that with the piping hot lentil pide, wrapped neatly in warm and freshly baked flatbread, provided a warm comfort reminiscent of homemade delights.

However, the shish kebab left much to be desired, missing the traditional flavors I've come to anticipate in such a classic dish. Ending the meal, the baklava failed to hit the notes I was hoping for, lacking the richness and sweetness I had expected.

While the service was adequate, I found the recommendations slightly off-point—not quite aligning with the thematic blend as hoped. The cozy, Deco-inspired ambiance promised more than the culinary journey delivered. It's a pleasant visit, yet somehow the experience collectively felt more underwhelming than matched with hype.

The octopus at Byblos was a highlight, nicely spiced and perfectly tender. It paired well with the fresh-out-the-oven lentil pide, which reminded me of cozy, homemade breads.

Exploring Byblos left me with mixed feelings. The Sujuk bread, a delightful 9/10, melted the moment I bit into it, and the Fig Salad evoked a 10/10, an exquisite blend of textures and sweet notes. The Shoulder of Lamb came tender and flavorful, earning an 8/10 for its savory depth. However, underneath the art deco ambience, the dim lighting detracted from the evening, striving to feel intimate but instead felt a bit stifled.

While the food captures the essence of bold, Mediterranean flavors, the uncomprised but slow service shifted the evening's joy. The waiter failed to engage and left a bitter memory with a futile and sneaky upsell of roasted almonds. Incidentally overpriced, I found the crispy couscous lacklustre, a mistaken choice that barely warranted a 5/10.

With Byblos, I found myself torn. Taking a bite of the Sujuk bread was pure bliss—it was soft, warm, and just right. The Fig Salad balanced textures and sweetness; it's easily one of the best salads I've tried. The lamb shoulder was all you’d expect from well-cooked meat, succulent and rich. Yet, the attempt at a cozy vibe fell flat due to the overly dim lighting—it felt more gloomy than intimate.

Although the food definitely brought the spirit of Mediterranean tastes, our experience was jarred by the pace of service. Our waiter barely chatted with us and tried to push some roasted almonds our way—awkward move, and those almonds were overpriced. And sadly, the crispy couscous disappointed me; it came off bland and uninspiring.

Even with some standout dishes, what we paid didn’t seem worthy of the inconsistent service. Not in a rush to go back.

Aloette made a great first impression. Located in a busy area, the prices were surprisingly affordable—I felt I got good value for my money, especially with the generous portions. The ambiance was a lively mix of casual and upscale, though it did get a bit noisy. Making reservations online was a breeze, starting the experience on a positive note.

The meal began delightfully with a complimentary cheesy bun that quickly became a table favorite.

The iceberg wedge salad, with its creamy chive dressing, offered a refreshing twist—and the octopus carpaccio, while tasty, seemed a tad expensive for the serving size.

Aloette provided one of the most memorable dining experiences during my stay in Toronto. Walking in sans reservation, I was pleasantly surprised to be seated with friendly efficiency – rare in upscale spots. The ambiance exuded a charming, relaxed warmth, a modern twist on the classic diner vibe.

I can't recommend the 'Nduja Stuffed Olive Skewer and Octopus Carpaccio enough—they were sublime, offering a delicate balance of flavors.

Neither the carpaccio nor scallops offered anything exceptional compared to other French-influenced spots. The agnolotti was okay but forgettable. 

Desserts let us down as well. The hazelnut cake was dry, and the house-made bread was far too salty and burnt. The cheerful staff turned the night nice, but the food made me think twice about visiting again.

Aloette's service impressed me; they offered a friendly coat check while efficiently maintaining a bustling environment. The dishes, however, fell short. Despite hearing rave reviews, the flavors didn’t match up. The scallop tostada and fried smelts stood out for their freshness and intriguing flavors, while the cornish hen was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. These were small glimmers in an otherwise dim dining experience. The highly talked-about pork was overly greasy, leaving a heavy feel, and the salmon was surprisingly ordinary. Although the vibey, energetic setting has its appeal, the cocktails alternated between expertly crafted and flat disappointments. This inconsistency paired with a steep $300 bill didn’t equate to the dining thrill I expected. Aloette promises a lot in reputation, yet sways between its promises, creating a disconnect that underwhelms.

Aloette knows how to welcome you. They kindly take your coat at the door and keep things running smoothly even when busy. Sadly, the food let me down a bit. Folks raved about it, but the taste didn’t blow me away. The scallop tostada and fried smelts were fresh and stood out, as was the well-seasoned Cornish hen. But these were rare hits. The much-talked-about pork was too greasy, and the salmon kind of bland. The place has good vibes and energy, but drinks were a hit or miss. With the $300 bill, the experience wasn’t as thrilling as I'd hoped. Aloette has a big reputation, yet it struggles to live up to it, which left me wanting more.

Rasa exceeded my expectations with its incredible blend of flavors and ambiance. Sitting at the bar with a window view created the perfect backdrop for enjoying the meal. The evening began with a delightful amuse-bouche—a bite of cheese bread with a touch of jalapeño—that set the stage for what was to come. This was followed by a wonderfully fresh chopped salad, which offered a perfect medley of crisp textures and vibrant hints of flavor. 

The menu is a treasure trove of tastes, and I savored the spicy ceviche, which was just extraordinary. The truffle gnudi stood out with its creamy lushness, balanced beautifully by zesty notes, while the chickpea fritter was a fun, flavorful bite. The team's warm and attentive service elevated the night, making every moment feel well-attended without being overbearing. I’m eager to explore more of Rasa’s diverse offerings on my next visit.

Rasa effortlessly captures the essence of a charming rustic cabin, offering a dining atmosphere that's both cozy and inviting. The ceviche was outstanding, harmonizing Thai-inspired flavors with impeccably fresh seafood, creating an unforgettable taste experience. The chickpea fritters added a touch of crunch, accompanied by a sauce that was as tempting as it was delightful. While the short rib was packed with flavor, it ventured slightly towards the overcooked side, but not enough to lessen the overall enjoyment. Each dish was beautifully presented, elevating the dining experience to a work of art. The service was truly the highlight, with staff seamlessly attentive and genuinely caring about guest satisfaction. Their warmth made the meal even more memorable. Overall, Rasa is a spot worth visiting for exceptionally crafted cuisine and an ambiance that feels just like home. Highly recommend!

Rasa nails that comfy cabin vibe, making you feel right at home. The ceviche stands out with Thai flavors and super fresh seafood, something you won't soon forget. The chickpea fritters bring a nice crunch, paired with a sauce that you could practically eat on its own. The short rib is tasty, maybe a touch over on the cook time, but it's not a dealbreaker. Every plate looks like it belongs in a magazine—seriously pretty. But it's the staff that really steals the show; they're spot-on helpful and seem to genuinely care about you enjoying your time. If you're into well-crafted food in a warm setting, make your way to Rasa. I'm singing its praises to all my friends!

Celebrating my birthday at Rasa was both delightful and puzzling. The evening kicked off deliciously with their creative cocktails, notably a tantalizing passionfruit margarita that struck a perfect balance of sweet and tart. Embracing the tapas-style dining, we delighted in sharing flavorsome dishes, attentively assisted by staff who navigated our dietary concerns with ease.

Particularly memorable were the truffle gnudi, steak tartare, and duck confit, each crafted skillfully to offer rich flavors worth savoring. However, the surprisingly high $28 price on the tartare was disappointing, especially later on when both of us experienced digestive woes; it was difficult not to suspect the tartare as the cultepr Erica face erts also let us down, lacking the expected burst of citrusy freshness.

Amidst the vibrant buzz, close seating left little room for personal space but added to Rasa's lively atmosphere. Cocktails and service were commendable, flavorful dishes mostly impressed. Yet

We started with amazing cocktails; the passionfruit margarita really hit the spot with its sweet and tangy punch. We embraced the shared small plates and the staff easily managed our dietary needs, which made the dining experience stress-free. The truffle gnudi, steak tartare, and duck confit stood out with their incredible flavors, though I found the tartare's $28 tag a bit steep—especially because we both ended up with unhappy stomachs later on. The green salad disappointed, lacking that refreshing citrus oomph we hoped for. The restaurant was loud and bustling, with tables set close, energizing some but squeezing others. The drinks and service stood out, and most of the dishes made our night enjoyable, despite a hiccup or two.

The flavors and presentation at Rasa truly impressed me—especially the octopus and duck leg, which were beautifully cooked and artistically plated. Each dish offered unique flavor combinations that deserved the praise they're known for. However, the portion sizes were disappointingly tiny for the price. We chose to share nine dishes among four people, which added up to a steep $330. This left us feeling that while the taste was on point, the value could have been much better. For a more satisfying experience, sticking to a few tapas or picking dishes with heartier portions might be a better strategy. While the ambiance was cozy and rustic, and service moving at a steady pace, the overall value didn't quite match expectations. I'd give Rasa a 2.5 out of 5, recognizing the quality but not the value.

At Rasa, the octopus and duck leg really stood out to me — cooked just right and served in a creative way. Each bite offered something different and is what people talk about. But honestly, the portions were so small for what they charged. We tried sharing nine dishes between four of us and still ended up with a $330 bill. While the food was tasty, it didn't feel worth the money. To fill up, you might want to opt for a couple of heartier plates or just stick to a few tapas. The place had a cozy, rustic vibe, and service was consistently paced. In the end, great tastes lacked in value for me. I'd rate Rasa around 2.5 out of 5 — excellent quality, but pricey for what you get.

I recently visited Jin Dal Lae, a gem nestled in Koreatown. Even with just a brief 15-minute wait, stepping into the intimate setting had a welcoming vibe. My meal began with a steaming hot stone bibimbap, perfectly balanced with its sweet sauce and packed generously with tender meat—truly a delight. The Yukgaejang was the perfect warm-up for a chilly day, with its spicy broth hitting the right notes without overwhelming. A highlight was the seafood pancake: glorious in its crispy texture, a must-try for sure.

Portions were hearty and kind on the wallet, making this dining experience even more satisfying.

I have high standards for Korean food, and Jin Dal Lae comes very close to authentic, establishing itself as one of the best in Toronto. The menu was brimming with choices, but the Beef Bulgogi Hot Plate and delicious selection of banchans didn’t disappoint. Their generous and flavorful portions are impressive, especially when the bill for five merely grazed the $20 mark—truly amazing value! The ambiance was cozy and familial; however, be prepared for the small dining space, meaning long waits are common without reservations. Regardless, the charm of this little spot shone through. The satisfying meal made the wait worthwhile, solidifying recommendations due to their remarkable food quality. Despite a shortage in waitstaff, their friendlier aspect further enhanced the dining experience. Perfect for genuine Korean food lovers seeking an affordable and satisfying meal.

My recent visit to Jin Dal Lae was a delightful adventure in trying Korean cuisine, but I wish I had skipped the Sizzling Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes. The dish promised a tantalizing experience but ultimately fell short; the beef was sliced too thin, losing its desired texture, while an overly sweet sauce masked any potential savoriness.

While I navigated through an abundance of flavor, it was marred by the cloying sweetness, overshadowing the tempting promise of a more robust and umami-tasting meal. It’s unfortunate, given the balance and texture were off considerably.

Still, surrounded by the cozy ambiance of this welcoming eatery, it’s easy to understand its popularity. Buzzing with locals, Jin Dal Lae exudes warmth, although there may be a wait during peak times. While my pick didn’t hit the mark this time, its charming atmosphere and varied menu still hold promise to explore other flavorful delights.

I went to Jin Dal Lae the other day, and it was quite the Korean food adventure. Honestly, I could have skipped the Sizzling Plate - Beef & Rice Cakes. It looked promising, but the beef was too thin, and the sauce way too sweet, washing out all other flavors. 

It felt like biting into sugar instead of savoring a meaty dish. Despite that, I enjoyed the warm, neighborhood vibe. It was busy, buzzing with regulars and locals.

Experiencing the vibrant essence of Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos was a delightful treat! The tacos were enormous, each a small culinary festival on its own, boasting rich, bold flavors that left a lasting impression. Trying the yellowfin tuna and spicy shrimp taco was a revelation, perfectly layered with distinct textures and a punchy zest. The mushroom and nopal taco was surprisingly hearty—topped with a generous portion of creamy guacamole and cheese, it felt fulfilling and deeply satisfying. 

Though the indoor seating and cash-only policy add a layer of planning, the ambiance—and those hot, freshly cooked tortilla chips—more than made up for it.

Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos serves up phenomenal tacos that never fail to impress with robust flavors and generous portions. Whether it's the vibrant Baja fish or the smoky marlin, each bite bursts with freshness, which explains why there's always a buzz around their small, popping space. Sadly, that same popularity brings quite the challenge. With merely four chairs indoors, anyone hoping for a leisurely sit-down will find themselves squeezing into standing space or taking to the streets of Kensington Market for a spot to savor their meal. The going is made tougher with their cash-only policy; in this day, the extra ATM trip feels like quite the inconvenience. It once added to the charm, but frankly, now it's a bit of a hurdle for repeat visits, pushing the idea of quick cash-run-confirmations onto my reluctant "pre-meal checklist." Despite the tempting food, it's the logistics that now make me hesitate.

Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos cooks up some amazing tacos. From the spicy marlin to the crispy Baja fish, every flavor stands out and tastes super fresh. No wonder there's always a crowd at their compact spot. The downside? Inside, there are only four chairs, so most of us end up standing or wandering around Kensington Market to eat. Plus, it's cash-only, which means having to make a dash to the ATM; a bit of a pain these days. It used to feel quirky, but now it feels annoying, especially when stopping by again and again. The food tempts me back, but dealing with these small hassles sometimes makes me second guess visiting.

I visited Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos expecting to be dazzled, but hometown charm doesn’t always match high accolades. Navigating through a chaotic line was just the beginning. What seemed like an endearing bustle turned into a frustrating semi-chaos, with people weaving around the standing-only spots in search of stability for their taco feasts.

When the famed tacos finally reached my hands, they didn't quite live up to the anticipation. The Baja Fish and Carnitas came well-stuffed, true, but tasted pedestrian rather than exceptional. Adding to the garden-variety experience, my longed-for chips were amiss; a pity since they offer vegetarian-friendly bites.

Standing out in vibrant Kensington juxtaposed with improved bites might redeem future visits. For now, the trip fell short of the lover’s tale I had heard over time-worn conversations.

I was really curious about all the hype I'd heard about Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos. Unfortunately, my experience started with a jumbled lineup that was a bit of a headache to get through. The excitement of being in a lively spot quickly turned into a hassle as people squeezed around tiny spaces to eat.

When I finally got my tacos, they were packed full, but I don't know—they just didn’t knock my socks off like I hoped. Somehow, they felt pretty average. Plus, I was bummed to find out they were out of chips; I guess that’s what I get for craving something veggie-friendly.

The place’s lively setting in Kensington does have potential, though. Maybe next time, the flavors will match its funky neighborhood vibe.
